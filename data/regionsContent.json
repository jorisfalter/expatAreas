Children spend a couple of hours outdoors at school, even in the winters. </p><p>Also if you do get cold a sauna is a great way to warm up!</p><p>Lots of technology companies, relative to the city of the country, and English is frequently the working language. </p><p>Cons: </p><p>The winters get cold, it has been -10°C for the past week, and it will get colder soon enough. </p><p>The winters are also dark. </p><p>As a UK-native the language is complex and alien, but willingness to learn and practice is appreciated - the con is that if you struggle to order something in broken Finnish people will usually switch to English, which helps you in the short-term, but screws you over in the long term. </p><p>Alcoholism is common, and winter depression, but the alcoholism in Scotland is significantly worse so don't go expecting something crazy. </p><p><a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38525825&'>Source</a></p>"
