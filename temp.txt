San Jose
Have not seen anyone post about San Jose yet so here goes. Obviously a great place for tech jobs and fantastic weather with virtually no snow or ice unless you drive 4 hours into the Sierra - cool winters and long warm dry summers. Single folks seem to prefer San Francisco, but San Jose is a great place for families to raise kids in suburbia. Housing is expensive it's true but there are also manufactured housing parks that are much cheaper and really very livable. A few parks even own their own land collectively but most charge a space rent of around $1200/mo that includes utilities. This space rent is a similar amount to what you would pay in real estate taxes on a million dollar 3 bed 2 bath SFH and in San Jose is controlled by law to not go up more than about 3%/year.

Helsinki, Finland.
Pros: Living in the capital city you don't need a car - a monthly bus-pass covers all the metro/tram/bus trips you need for €50 or so. The city is also very walkable, which is particularly good for children.

If you have children they can go to daycare from 1year old, and the cost of that is subsidized, they start school properly at age of 7 and generally take themselves there (mostly by walking, some might cycle or take a bus).

The cities are safe, the houses are expensive but not out of reach, and renting isn't so bad, most buildings have double/triple glazing and are very well insulated.

Nature is easy to reach, and readily appreciated. Children spend a couple of hours outdoors at school, even in the winters. Also if you do get cold a sauna is a great way to warm up!

Lots of technology companies, relative to the city of the country, and English is frequently the working language.

Cons: The winters get cold, it has been -10°C for the past week, and it will get colder soon enough. The winters are also dark. As a UK-native the language is complex and alien, but willingness to learn and practice is appreciated - the con is that if you struggle to order something in broken Finnish people will usually switch to English, which helps you in the short-term, but screws you over in the long term.

Alcoholism is common, and winter depression, but the alcoholism in Scotland is significantly worse so don't go expecting something crazy.
