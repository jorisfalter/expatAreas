The city is also very walkable, which is particularly good for children.<br>If you have children they can go to daycare from 1year old, and the cost of that is subsidized, they start school properly at age of 7 and generally take themselves there (mostly by walking, some might cycle or take a bus).<br>The cities are safe, the houses are expensive but not out of reach, and renting isn't so bad, most buildings have double/triple glazing and are very well insulated.<br>Nature is easy to reach, and readily appreciated. Children spend a couple of hours outdoors at school, even in the winters. Also if you do get cold a sauna is a great way to warm up!<br>Lots of technology companies, relative to the city of the country, and English is frequently the working language.<br>Cons: The winters get cold, it has been -10°C for the past week, and it will get colder soon enough. The winters are also dark. As a UK-native the language is complex and alien, but willingness to learn and practice is appreciated - the con is that if you struggle to order something in broken Finnish people will usually switch to English, which helps you in the short-term, but screws you over in the long term.<br>Alcoholism is common, and winter depression, but the alcoholism in Scotland is significantly worse so don't go expecting something crazy."
