Motorcycle/car noise in IJburg,"Hey Folks!

As someone who is living in IJburg (close to IJburglaan) for a while now, I noticed a lot of motorcyclists and car drivers who use the long street to speed up and cause extreme noise and thus nuisance, even easily noticeable with closed window and often in the evening, almost every day.

Is there any chance to do ""something about it"" (speed bumps, more controls or similar), or is it just bad luck?",3,3,eVoliumTV

,"Yessss more speed bumps!

God I hate expats.",,,
I got assaulted at Cafe Oranje in West and I need the videos,"Hello, I‚Äôm using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I was assaulted and beat up by three men at Cafe Oranje in the bar yesterday during the Netherlands and Romania match. They were bullying me and my girlfriend and when I asked them to be respectful they responded by pushing me outside and started beating me on my face and knocking me out while still beating me toll I was unconscious and had to be taken away by the ambulance. They also tore my girlfriend‚Äôs clothes. 

I understand there were witnesses there, and I hope I can get some of the videos or pictures that were taken there. 

I was knocked out and my girlfriend was in shock so we didn‚Äôt have a chance to get the videos from people, but I‚Äôm hoping someone might see it here. I‚Äôm not sure if the police got the videos from the witnesses, because when I called them the number said they didn‚Äôt know. The police non-emergency number dumbly actually told me to go back to the same place to try and get the video from people or the cafe, yeah right.

Also, any videos that were taken during the game would be of real help! We know what these people look like and can identify them. Maybe there‚Äôs the off chance that they were filmed before this happened and we can use that with the police to identify them.  

I think will be able to use this video to find the suspects who assaulted me and bring them to justice. Please send if you were there. Thank you in advance. 

Also, any advice is welcome. I got a lawyer who is my friend‚Äôs dad who offered to represent us for free.

Update: I want to thank you all for your very helpful replies and kind words. It is indeed a traumatic experience. I have received one video so far (literally of me being knocked out) and will go to the police to add it to my statement and the report. If you were there or have any videos, please send me a dm. I‚Äôll buy you a beer for it :) 

Second update: 
I called the bar. One of the women picked up and said they didn‚Äôt have cameras. I told them I have a video of the people punching me, and maybe could use their help identifying these people. They said they can‚Äôt help and it‚Äôs bad for business. They said if it happened inside it would have been a different story, but it happened outside. So they said they can‚Äôt really help. The incident actually started inside, I was pushed inside to the outside of the bar and I was assaulted right next to the chairs that belong to the bar on their terrace basically, which is on the street.

During the incident, however, when things were escalating and I tried to get the man who was bartending involved I asked him ‚Äúwho are these people and why are they treating me like this?‚Äù he said ‚Äúthese people are regulars.‚Äù Should I go to the barman and ask him who these people were? Or should I leave this up to the police? Maybe they can take the video and actually do their job of finding these people? How much do I need to take matters into my own hands?",698,157,Throwaway-Adam
,"So sorry to hear about what happened to you . . . horrific.

May or may not be an obvious suggestion, but perhaps contacting the caf√© staff on duty that day could help with identifying the men? Perhaps they paid by card and their names are on record?",,,

My friend recorded the incident on his phone, including license plate number. He called the police, who showed up after the attacker left.

,"How did it happen? can you tell the whole story? Are you Romanian? How did the conflict arise? It's somewhat odd for Dutch Oranje fans in a small cafe to start beating up on one guy and especially just one dude who's with his gf just out of the blue. You just asked them to be respectful and they immediately proceeded to jump you? Were you all drunk?   
It's fucked that three dudes jumped you and no one helped out. Usually people try to break it up at least.  
Were they caucasian or mixed ethnicity?  
I'm asking because depending on the severity of your ""injuries"" you may want to let it go. It was just a fight.  
Or go back and look for them and if you find them tell them to man up and square up one on one.  
The police are usually useless and very reluctant to make a case as to them it was just a fight and they are understaffed.   
Like I said, it all depends on the severity of your injuries and I'm guessing they are no that bad.  
I know, many snowflakes here will disagree and downvote me but I live in the real world and have fought and many times you just let it go. It's not worth your energy. Even if they catch them the penalty's are a joke.  
Probably some community service IF that.  
It's important to note that if everyone was drunk it's a very different scenario than if everyone was sober.  
Two very different worlds.  
This is why I don't drink alcohol and stay away from drunk people.  


ps. You've responded to others now and ""confirming"" it was a very traumatic experience, but it's only as traumatic as you want it to be. I'm trying to help you by advising you to let it go. Don't be a victim other than just a victim of life and existence.   
Man up so to speak and see it as just another fight or maybe even your first. It happens.   
Either that OR pursue it but realize it will cause lots and lots of stress and may no be worth it plus there will be a price to pay.   
Me, personally being nuts, I would go back to the cafe every day or as much as I can. I'd look for them if I'm feeling vengeful.   
Def don't do this, but I'm guessing you're not that type anyways.  
  
Why don't you go back to the cafe to at least ask for some info to track down those dudes?",,,

The police will follow up and decide what to do. Also keep in mind that people on the footage can make a case against  you related to breach of portrait rights and defamation in case you are watching, storing or spreading (social media) the images of security cameras.

,"Excellent idea, but actually for another reason. According to AVG (dutch privacy laws) only police or other official instances etc can 'legally get a hold of camera footage, esp when it comes from businesses. I know this because I was in a car accident that led to a big insurance dispute. Getting the footage was extremely difficult. There was a coffee shop with a ton of cameras where it happened. They were super nice (bc they were my neighbors)  and saved the footage for me on a USB before it got automatically deleted. But to have it be released for the case was a bureaucratic shit hole. It took weeks of bothering the insurance company, until I finally just begged the shop to just give the USB to me so I could send the footage myself. Which thankfully they did but only bc of goodwill bc I knew them. 
So go to the bar, they will definitely remember and probably very willing to help but might not be able to immediately bc of the AVG laws. Ask the personel there to get the owner involved and save the footage at least. If they are wishy washy keep pushing, footage generally gets deleted 7-30 days. And push the police too to retrieve the footage. Its essential!! 

Something horrible happened to you, the people who did it need to be brought to justice. I know you're probably still hurting a lot but when it comes to video proof time is of the essence. Also contact AT5, keep an eye on Dumpert etc etc. Besides the bars footage as you said, there will defo have been bystanders.",,,

So I‚Äôm curious, which country would you call not racist?

I agree it‚Äôs an issue we should work on, and it‚Äôs good to try to make Dutch people aware that our country is certainly not perfect, even though Dutch people might think it is. But if you‚Äôre truly interested in improving the situation, calling an entire country racist is not the way to go about it.

,"I agree with you both but I would like to point out that there is a Long Covid crisis that most governments are trying to hide, if you look at the unions for nurses e.g. in England they have been screaming and warning for two years now that many nurses are disabled or can't return to work because of Long Covid. 

I won't spam you all with this but you can look at sick leaves data.in many countries. In the Netherlands some healthcare workers demanded compensations because many of them developed Long Covid as well, some union members talked on the radio (not during peak hour sadly).

If you wanna know more Harvard (with David Cutler) are measuring the impact of the pandemic, and whilr you don't see many deaths anymore, there are millions of people in each country who get Long Covid, the risk is more or less around 15-25% depending on so many factors, but everyone is at risk. Especially workers who are exposed to crowds a lot, so that's why you see understaffed departments in hospitals, healthcare settings, firemen, police officers (in some countries the police actually got rekt a lot, and surprise that's where the amount of anti maskers and antivaxxers were significant too, like in some US states e.g.)

So yes unions can say that they understaffed as excuse sometimes but the past few years, since 2020 actually, they have been hit hard with sickness.

Many economists and medical historians warned the world about this in 2020 by the way, you have the Pandemic Economics papers funded by the EU (some of my professors even published there üòÑ), and other hundreds of scientists who published on Nature reminding us that there is always an increase in disability following a pandemic (and considering we are not really in the post period you can do the maths).

Amsterdam overtourism: City moves to ban cruise ships,,414,103,guyoffthegrid
,"‚ÄúAmsterdam is taking new steps to fight back against overtourism by launching plans to relocate its passenger cruise terminal to outside of the city centre.

‚Äã‚ÄãBy 2035, none of the boats will be able to dock in the iconic capital.

Currently, the amount permitted is 190, but that‚Äôs slated to go down to a maximum of 100 from 2026.

It‚Äôs been agreed that Rotterdam in the south will take more than 40 ships not welcome in Amsterdam from 2026.

However, the war on tourists in Amsterdam has been so wildly mismanaged, the municipality has been great at mismanagement. We live in an open-air museum and we need income to pay for the insane cost of keeping it all the same. Tourism is a great way to generate that income. However, we should focus on making it more expensive for tourists and leveraging that, any other method of reducing tourists doesn‚Äôt work.",,,

,"This is a bit of a reversal of what is actually going on. What is going on is that the city thinks new bridges in Oost and West are more important than some tall cruise ships. So a new location for the cruise terminal was being looked at and only Coenhaven was deemed suitable enough. If it's too expensive or it doesn't work out, then too bad, no more big cruise ships. Taking all this account there is also a limited willingness to invest in the cruise tourism industry since it's seen as environmentally harmful and superfluous (not like we need the tourism with the records that keep getting broken).

Absolutely insane take. We're keeping the city in good order and condition because that's the right thing to do. It's what we always have done and what other non-touristy Dutch towns also do. What the humongous amounts of visitors to our city do is increase the cleaning budget through the roof. Also note that we have police capacity allocated by The Hague based on the number of residents, those millions of tourists a year are not counted, but they do get involved in a lot of crime as well (either targeted or participating). The city has been begging The Hague for years now.

,"I have no idea how they do it in Rotterdam. As far as I know in Amsterdam, the river cruises (smaller ships not the huge one) for example have guided tours in the city. They use public transport to travel through the city and visit museums, restaurants etc. If they are docked for two days, they will visit the city and are visiting shops and local restaurants. Besides that the guides are also local people, I‚Äôve never seen a group of young people from the UK taking a guided tour or visit a museum. They are focused on partying and spending the least possible and visit the big (candy)stores in the Kalverstraat.

In my opinion if they want to solve the problem of overtourism, start with Airbnb. The amount of flights coming in from the UK is insane. A good amount of these people are the ones that see Amsterdam as a big party jungle and don‚Äôt show respect to the city nor the people.

I found my stolen bike! Now what?,"Alright so, about a year ago I had the universal Amsterdam experience of having my bike stolen- I'd left it with only the back lock on, in front of my uni building in broad daylight for about 3 hours. It was a crappy bike that had very recently been fixed- new chain, new wheel- and most importantly it was painted bright purple/blue, I honestly couldn't belive it was stolen in these circumstances- but i shouldn't have underestimated Amsterdam.

This morning I saw it again, parked by Zuid, its back lock open but tied up with a chain. It's 100% the same one, down to the bell and two little red zip ties on the back. I couldn't stop long since I had to catch a train, and it probably won't be there again tonight.

What should I do in this situation, if i see it again? I definitley don't wanna call the cops, and honestly I have very little hope of seeing it again, but still, if anyone has any ideas of what I should do in this situation I'd appreciate any advice. :))

I acquired a property in Amsterdam around 5 years ago. It has an existing rooftop (larger than 50% of the roof) that has been there since 1997 and exclusive right of use through VVE and Deed of Division. However, a permit has never been applied for or achieved.

Homo-vriendelijke kerken?,"Hoi, in het kort: ik (20M), voel me al jaren wegezakken in een sleur van oppervlakkig bestaan en gebrek aan gemeenschap, ik ben 'athe√Østisch opgevoed' en heb het tot voorkort niet eens in mijn hoofd gehaald om me aan een religie te hechten omdat ik het zag als enkel dogma en repressie, en dus omdat ik gay ben.

Ik laat mijn religieuze openbaringen buiten beschouwing, maar het lezen van de bijbel heeft me in ieder geval doen nadenken over het ontsnappen van mijn individualisme en wat het is om een moreel hoogwaardig leven te leiden (ookal weet ik niet of ik daadwerkelijk in God geloof). 

Ik vraag me af of er katholieke kerken zijn in Amsterdam waar je terecht kan als homo? De gemeenschap, tradities en dynamische aard van het katholicisme spreken mij meer aan dan het protestantisme, maar ik weet dat protestanten over het algemeen clementer zijn over dit soort dingen. Ik ben vrij duidelijk gay: draag elke dag make-up + mijn stem (lol), en ik vind het dus best spannend om zomaar een kerk binnen te wandelen op die manier. Heeft iemand hier ervaring mee?

Maar natuurlijk zal het realistisch per gemeenschap altijd wel een beetje verschillen hoe de individuen erover denken. Toch denk ik dat je bij Oud-katholieken de beste kans hebt, hoewel je gelijk hebt dat het bij Protestantse gemeentes vaak makkelijker is.

Er zit een groot verschil tussen de houding van de kerk en van hun parochianen. De katholieke kerk blijft echter als geheel homoseksualiteit afwijzen. Bij protestanten is het in de praktijk aan de plaatselijke gemeente. Migrantenkerken buiten beschouwing gelaten zullen veruit de meeste kerken welwillend staan tegenover het praktiseren van homoseksualiteit.


Op enkele uitzonderingen na geldt dat ook kerken die hier afwijzend tegenover staan, hier in gesprekken niet direct een punt van zullen maken. Pas bij (het voorbereiden op) lidmaatschap zal het wellicht aan de orde komen. De verhalen in diverse media zijn excessen, die hoe ernstig ook, niet de regel, maar de uitzondering zijn.

,"Putting my homosexuality on display on reddit and now admitting I'm uniquely inspired by Dasha..  gay and regarded, will pray on it",,,
,"Dit hangt van je vertaling en exegese af. Als je een concordante(re) vertaling zoals de Statenvertaling neemt zul je zien dat hier twee verschillende woorden staan, niet 'man' en 'man', maar:

>Wanneer ook een man bij een manspersoon zal gelegen hebben, met vrouwelijke bijligging, zij hebben beiden een gruwel gedaan; zij zullen zekerlijk gedood worden; hun bloed is op hen! Leviticus 20:13 SV

Dus niet een 'man' met een 'man', maar een 'man' met een 'manspersoon'! Waarom gebruikt de Statenvertaling hier twee verschillende termen?

Nou, het Hebreeuws heeft daar immers ook twee verschillende woorden: ◊ô◊© ('ƒ´sj) en ◊ñ◊õ◊® (zachƒÅr):

◊ï◊ê◊ô◊© ◊ê◊©◊® ◊ô◊©◊õ◊ë ◊ê◊™÷æ◊ñ◊õ◊® ◊û◊©◊õ◊ë◊ô ◊ê◊©◊î ◊™◊ï◊¢◊ë◊î ◊¢◊©◊ï ◊©◊†◊ô◊î◊ù ◊û◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊ï◊û◊™◊ï ◊ì◊û◊ô◊î◊ù ◊ë◊ù◊É

Als dit een verbod op sexuele relaties tussen hetzelfde geslacht zou moeten zijn, dus een man met een man, zou ik hier verwachten dat er wordt gezegd dat een 'ƒ´sj niet mag liggen met een *'ƒ´sj*, maar dat staat er dus niet! Waarom is hier voor twee verschillende termen gekozen?

Deze tekst wordt ook wel ge√Ønterpreteerd als een verbod op het Hellenistische (Griekse) gebruik dat oudere mannen zich bij jonge jongens opwierpen als 'mentor', en met hen ook sexuele relaties hadden. Toen Leviticus werd geschreven, rond 400 v. Chr., stond namelijk Judea onder Hellenistische en Perzische invloed, en daar wordt tegen geageerd. Leviticus 20 keurt dit gebruik, dat we tegenwoordig als pedofilie zouden bestempelen, net als bestialiteit en incest af, net als rituelen met zgn. magische krachten, etc. Overigens worden bijvoorbeeld de Joodse spijswetten in Leviticus ook niet breed gedragen onder de meeste moderne Christenen.

Hetzelfde geldt overigens voor de brieven: 'mannen die met mannen liggen' in de eerste Brief aan de Korinti√´rs is met 5 woorden nogal een uitgebreide vertaling van het enkele woord 'ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒπ', dat Paulus heeft opgeschreven. De Vulgaat vertaalt hier met *masculorum concubitores*, 'met het mannelijke liggen', wat inderdaad ook een mogelijke vertaling van *zachƒÅr* is, maar Gr. 'malakos' (overigens van dezelfde Indo-Europese wortel als het Nederlandse 'mals'), wordt elders ook vertaald als, inderdaad; 'verwijfd', maar ook: 'zacht', 'laf' of 'week'. 'Ruggegraatlozen' is misschien net zo goed een steekhoudende vertaling in deze context van vreemdgangers, dronkaards, dieven, pooiers en hoerenlopers.

Los van bovenstaande haarkloverij over de juiste vertaling van woorden in een meer dan duizend jaar oude taal, uit een paar contextloze citaten die jij hierboven het internet opsmijt als bewijs van je eigen gelijk, kunnen we misschien beter ook kijken naar de geest van wet. Paulus herhaalt Leviticus wanneer hij oproept tot liefde en echtelijke trouw; en vreemdgaan, prostitutie en sexueel wangedrag sterk afkeurt. Nog steeds een prima handvat voor een christen in 2024 voor een fijne relatie, denk ik zelf.

De Bijbelse onderbouwing voor afwijzing van homoseksualiteit is met een lezing van de tekst in de brontaal niet bijzonder sterk, denk ik. Een christen die zijn naaste hierop zou willen beoordelen moet eerst de balk uit zijn eigen oog halen, wat mij betreft.",,,
,"He wasn't asking for this shit, so keep it to yourself please.",,,
,"Geloven kunnen heus wel vriendelijk zijn, het zijn de kerkgemeenschappen die het probleem zijn. Ik ken veel christenen van vele stromingen die niet meer naar de kerk gaan omdat ze het niet eens zijn met de meningen die gedeeld worden. Het is het feit dat de kerk een manier van denken draait, en omdat ze zeggen dat het uit de bijbel komt wordt het geloofd door mensen. Maar als je zelf de bijbel leest, waarbij je ook echt oude versies onderzoekt, kom je erachter dat de kerk de bijbel naar eigen mening draait",,,

Also great to know about MagicCon - it looks huge and we should figure out a collab next year, because I think a lot of Magic fans might love The Alchemist (please let me know what you thought of it after you've played!)

cheers, Victor",,,

Password was very creative and out of the box, not one of the standard escape room themes. And Podr√≥≈º is very original as well and technically advanced. There were several ""wow""-moments for us :)

The second one ""Room Escape Warszawa"" has 3 locations with several excellent rooms. Olympus had the best surprise I ever saw I think and great effects. Also Musketeers was just as beautiful and Submarine was great with one cool element I never had before (don't want to spoil it). 

We only did one room at ""Mysterious Room"" (it is not in the city center) and it was fantastic: ""The mystery of Mayan temple"". We especially liked the way it was set up, not linear, very refreshing. And the atmosphere and sound effects. We really want to come back for ""Magician from Muveszet district"" but we ran out of time.

Weekly Q&A - All Questions Go Here (Especially Tourists and New Residents),"
This is the place for anyone to ask questions about Amsterdam. If you are a tourist visiting Amsterdam, you are moving to or recently arrived in Amsterdam, or you just have a basic question about life in Amsterdam and want some advice, this is the place to post your question. This post is refreshed every week on Sunday. Please feel free to repost in subsequent weeks.

**READ THE WIKI FIRST.** The people answering questions are locals who want to share the city they love with visitors, but only with people who make an effort. Read at least the Essential Tourist Information in our [world-famous wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/wiki/index) before you ask a question. Otherwise, you may be told to go back and read it. The wiki is written by us, and updated when relevant. If the entries are old it's because nothing has changed.

**HOTELS ARE EXPENSIVE AND WE DON'T HAVE GOOD ADVICE ON THEM.** Because we live here, we don't know what the best hotels are. Amsterdam is one of the most touristed cities in the world and has the [highest hotel prices](https://www.cheaprooms.co.uk/press/spring18.html) in Europe. The city is deliberately [trying to reduce tourism by raising the prices](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/amsterdam-bans-new-hotels-fight-against-mass-tourism-2024-04-17/). There really isn't a secret ""cheap"" solution. Most ""Airport"" hotels are not connected to the Airport and will be more trouble getting to than it's worth.

**TOURISTS CAN PURCHASE MARIJUANA, DESPITE WHAT YOU READ IN FOREIGN PRESS.** Understand that the coffeeshops are just a tiny part of Amsterdam, so posts that treat Amsterdam like it's the Las Vegas of drugs sometimes get a negative response. We're happy to give you advice about coffeeshops and to discuss drug policy. The experts are our friends at /r/AmsterdamEnts, ask them the big questions.

**WE DON'T HELP WITH ILLEGAL STUFF AND WILL BAN YOU FOR ASKING.** We will not help you with things that are clearly illegal. Coffeeshops caught selling to minors get shut down and everyone loses their jobs. Authorities check for people smuggling marijuana out of the country. Hard drugs are illegal and so is asking for or selling them on Reddit.

**WE DON'T ALLOW TICKET SALES OR TRADING.** We do not allow selling, buying, or trading tickets on /r/Amsterdam due to the high rate of fraud. You should do everything on ticketswap.nl. We're aware that is difficult to get tickets to Anne Frank, van Gogh, etc. We have no solutions for you, sorry.

**WE PROBABLY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE RED LIGHT DISTRICT** but you can get some good tips from [this thread from a sex worker](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/193zi9j/i_am_a_sex_worker_in_the_red_light_district_if/).  

**DOE AARDIG.** There is Dutch directness and there is rudeness. The people coming here don't know how we do things, and are usually well-meaning people who just want to enjoy the city we love. Be kind to them. For the tourists and new residents, please remember that we are not Google; respect our time by doing some basic research first and then asking your questions like you're speaking to a real human who is volunteering to speak to you.

Any chance that anyone here works at a souvenir shop or happens to pass by souvenir shops in Amsterdam to look if it's still for sale? I know it's incredibly unlikely. It was a black t-shirt. It had a large illustration of the city skyline + the sky was like, Starry Night style, but it was all in bright neon colors. Underneath the illustration it said ""Amsterdam"" in pink script.

,"They sit in an often time noisy uncomfortable cabins on a strict schedual that is often times impossible to stick to. If they delay too much management will come to complain, however things such as the amount of supply vans/cars/garbage trucks that block their path causes them to have delays. 

The trams themselves sometimes have issues or they miss their second person because of schedule mistakes, if an accident happens they will often have to be informed by head office and that creates spontaneous new routes and that will throw the whole time table off. Like any big company everything has to be increasingly more cheap with less workers and head office is becoming more and more detached from the field workers and they make decisions that don't make sense. Such as every time you turn a corner and hear screeching, that's the metal grinding together and it's bad for both the floor and the track. But instead of getting better suited trams they will just replace the tracks every few years, because that's cheaper somehow. 

And on top of all that, most people don't greet them, they don't get talked to in a kind way, and they have to explain which doors to use a million times a day even though there is a sticker RIGHT THERE at eye level. They are listening to the beep beeping of cards all day and people will get aggressive and blame them for delays by hitting the tram, cursing, middle fingers.  And they have to  deal with aggressive or confused people, people who are drunk or high, aggressive towards their other passengers.

ALSO people forget how dangerous trams can be, I've seen first hand (driving back home toghether with dad) people be outright reckless thinking they can run past a tram (with a baby stroller first) or cyclists not paying attention, cars being unpredictable. They can't really brake well because the wheels will just slide. They have to be SUPER alert not to hit a population which seemingly thinks they are invincible. 

My dad has once seen an accident happen decades ago on a crossing where a young driver hit someone and panicked, my dad used his own belt to tourniquet a leg. Those accidents are traumatic. I've seen the tram driver who was in a deadly accident earlier this year, I hitched a ride home with my dad and we saw him in the remise, according to my father a very nice man, and he looked absolutely gutted. He was a ghost being led by his arm by someone from the police.  


All in all, it's not exactly grateful work, and when people ask ""stupid"" questions without saying hello first(such as shouting a tourist attraction or stop) they get cranky.

Facilities and places within the city for one to clean and maintain one‚Äôs own bicycles?,"Hi Dutch redditors,

Living in Amsterdam and owning two bicycles (one for daily commute and another for sports), I recently found myself feeling quite restricted in available facilities and capabilities when it comes to the topic of maintaining and repairing my bicycles. I wonder if others face the same challenges and how did you overcome it?

Some tasks I am trying to achieve are for example:

1. Washing the bicycle. Ideally with a pressure washer, but if not, at least an open space to hand wash the bicycle. But with the lack of my own home garage, it‚Äôs hard to find a place in the city with an area to pressure wash things. 
2. Space to dismantle part or whole of bicycle. For example I found myself wanting to take apart the cassette of my bike to be stripped of grease in preparation for wax lubrication. But I found the space around my apartment lacking, plus this job I also requires well-ventilated space for the fumes of solvents to evaporate (benzene, spirits etc)
3. Specialized tools to do above tasks. (chain wrench, crank puller, etc). Since these tools only gets used once in a while, it only makes sense to avoid buying and owning them, and I wonder if there are any initiatives where these tools could be shared use (something like Peerby for bikes owners?)

I know the easy way would be to go for commercial solutions (there‚Äôs a bike wasserette near de Pijp that charges ‚Ç¨40 for a full pressure wash, or just go to a bicycle shop everytime I need something taken apart), but the costs really do add up and it‚Äôd be much more economical to do periodic maintenance oneself.

As I live in an apartment as do many others, I wonder what are your solutions to some of these problems considering we live in a tight city.

Any help or feedback is appreciated!",6,9,Regular-Bicycle-5862

--  
Blocked crybaby so can't post a new comment, but I'll break it down because I got a couple minutes to kill why not.

Why is a car inefficient?

Okay, pretty much every one I've ever seen has minimum four seats, but one person in it moving around back and forth to work.  That's inefficient.

You can only go certain routes by car, so you are forced to travel using streets that likely aren't a direct shot to your destination.  Inefficient.

You can't get to your destination even once you arrive.  You have to get to a parking spot/lot.  So you end up paying and walking.  Inefficient.

They cost money on gas/electric.

They damage streets.

They pollute.

They're loud.

Specifically, in Amsterdam, the streets aren't built for them, and you're just trying to bump your way around like a dumbass.  Very inefficient... and dumb.

Now let's go ahead and tell me what the pros are?

You get the privilege of sitting in your own room instead of on a train.  Okay, I guess?   Makes sitting in that traffic burn a little less, I suppose.

Think I got scammed at the RLD,So it was my second to last night in Amsterdam and I wanted to go have fun before the next night where I‚Äôd be worried about my flight the next day. So I went about found a girl and we agreed that 100 euro for the initial 20 minutes and when we get to the bed she keeps telling me about the prices of other stuff so I cave and pay what she told me was 150 euros to feel her chest. Then she kept pressuring me about paying for more stuff using all my credit cards and every card I have on Apple Pay. So I‚Äôm like you know what let me just get out of here while I can. So I wake up to an email saying my card was charged 367 Canadian dollars which converts to roughly 256 euros. So she charged me more than we agreed on but now I don‚Äôt really know what to do.

,"Xenophobia is completely different. It is however completely passive agressive to suddenly start saying 'glad OP got home ok' as if to point out I dont care. Backhanded shit like that is bullshit. Yes it was a generalization, based on very clear evidence. Fearmongering is how both extremes in the US look to get voters. It is tearing the US apart. So me just pointing out that affirming an irrational fear is not the helthiest thing doesnt seem out of place. I was not trying to decipher your national identity, i deciphered you nationality based on your pattern in the post and confirmed it with your other posts before commenting. Besides, the US is wildly more dangerous for both Americans and Tourists statistically. So this whole idea that getting home safely is relevant is dumb with NL being safer than most of the world. Personal anecdotes? The amount of smudged backpacks is so high it isnt even worth it to count. Fine, she didnt lean against anything as far as she can remember. People bump into you, have something on their shoe and brush against your bag in the floor. Do you really think human trafficking happens in the train, tram or airfield? It happens at night, in the shadows not in the departures hall where cops with SMGs walk around. Amsterdam is primarily a destination for trafficked humans. 20% is Dutch, after that the largest amount is eastern european. Drug trafficking in marked backpacks, such as those shown, is not gonna happen. Carry on without hard areas is going to get intercepted 100%. Again, irrational fears. Why entertain them.",,,
,"Thanks for understanding. We tried to wipe it off with a wet wipe which is why it's kinda smudgy but it does seem to be Sharpie or something similar (at my best guess)

It was my first holiday outside the country without my parents so I'm just being extra cautious since it was just me and a friend, and we're obviously the sort of people that would be targeted. 

I had a pretty bad time in the Netherlands with how rude/aloof most Dutch people seemed to be towards us so it kinda sucks to come onto here and once again be treated so rudely over an innocent question. Pretty bad impression overall tbh lol.... I was glad when the holiday was over and I could go back home to Scotland ü´§ (although the people in Leiden were awesome)

But yeah, my instincts are my instincts. And I know for a fact if I'd leaned on something - it would be on the bag way more than a single spot. Hopefully it was just kids being vandals.",,,

Xenophobia, n.

When I addressed you, I did not mention or even assume your nationality. But you did mine by making a nasty generalization. You are basing your understanding of my perspective purely through an outlandish lens of American politics, which has nothing to do with this particular situation. I‚Äôm genuinely confused by this randomness.

So, I‚Äôm going to continue talking to you like a human being.

I did not verbally back hand you. I meant it genuinely, and I apologize you viewed it that way. However, I do not like your downplaying a woman‚Äôs instinct to protect herself by dumbing it down as mere paranoia. You are avoiding the argument.

The comparison between US and NL crime rates and ‚Äúthis whole idea of getting home safely is relevant is dumb‚Äù is a blatant straw man.

Who said anything about sex trafficking or any other crime under the sun? If this were intentional, we would have no idea why. They could have marked her for death or to win a grand prize for being such an excellent tourist. Or it could be just a random smudge. We don‚Äôt know.

My whole issue is your downplaying her concerns by labeling as paranoia. You could have simply said it‚Äôs probably nothing, and you have no knowledge of criminals marking bags.

,"1. It becomes paranoia when the fear is unfounded. I can be scared of dying, reasonable. But being afraid of dying by having a brink fall on your head is paranoia, because the odds are so low it isn't worth making a big deal about it. The odds of this being an intended incident are low for one, but to also immediately believe there was ill intent and danger in broad day light is really farfetched. Paranoia might be too strong a word, I initally used it for comedic effect. Doesn't change my intent of indicating it is completely unfounded.  
2. Xenophobia is not applicable. I have a strong dislike for hyperboles and polarization. It happens in Europe and also in the Netherlands. Worldwide, the biggest source and most intermingled in daily vocabulary and worldview has sadly become the US. The source? American Exceptionalism and Demagogus rising. Since you like dictionaries: 'a political leader who seeks support by appealing to the desires and prejudices of ordinary people rather than by using rational argument.' People are herded like cattle based on things these demagogues tell them to fear, things that are arbitrary most of the time. You chose to feed her fear, an unnecessary fear. I likened it to that. I don't dislike the US, I don't dislike any American individually (without reason, orange man bad). I do dislike what is going on politically worldwide and how it gets adopted into common narrative. The Dutch/EU political state pisses me off.  
3. It's not a strawman, its fact. Just look up the rates.  
4. Me assuming your nationality was not an assumption. It is blatantly obvious. Additionally I merely pressed that feeding unfounded fears in other people is dangerous. I shouldnt have gone further than that, I will say that.

Beware of Fraudulent Wholesale Company Satiatus Zorg from Amsterdam,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a cautionary tale about a fraudulent company I recently encountered, hoping to prevent others from falling victim to the same scam.

The company in question is Satiatus Zorg, which claims to be a wholesale beauty products supplier based in Amsterdam. They have a professional-looking website (satiatuszorg.com) and provided what seemed like valid contact details, including an address at Meer en Vaart 00048 A, 1068ZZ Amsterdam, and a VAT number NL004011627B91.

I placed an order with them for beauty products, amounting to ‚Ç¨1469.70. After I made the payment, the company completely disappeared. They stopped responding to my emails and calls, and I never received the products I paid for. Despite numerous attempts to get in touch, all communication has ceased.

This company appears to be engaging in deliberate and malicious fraud, taking money from unsuspecting consumers and then vanishing. I have reported this incident to the relevant authorities and consumer protection agencies, but I wanted to make the community aware as well.

Please be extremely cautious if you come across Satiatus Zorg or any similar entities. Verify the legitimacy of any wholesale suppliers thoroughly before making any payments. If anyone else has had a similar experience or has advice on further actions I can take, I would appreciate your input.

Stay safe, and let‚Äôs look out for each other!

Best regards,

Dominick, ELLO Trade s.r.o.",2,4,PresentBeginning8849
,"So you thought it was a good idea to:

* [Order at a website that only existed a few months](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/satiatuszorg.com)

* Doesn't even have an normal payment/checkout system
* Do directly a massive order over 1000 euro....

It's easy to find English speaking therapists in countries like Poland and it's (relatively) cheap even paying out of pocket. I actually knew someone who even got their Dutch health insurance to cover their foreign therapy sessions because he wanted to speak with someone from his culture in his language (he did this via his GP). I use a therapist in Malaysia, where I used to live. The quality of care is very good and they all speak English, it's only 33eu/session.",,,

,"I used to study at Amsterdam University back in 2020-2021 - terrible year both due to COVID aftermaths and how severe the local measurements were. They ended up not allowing any offline classes at all despite some of the students coming there and wasting their opportunity to get a cheap accomodation (which is only allowed for one year). The online classes were a complete mess, zero interaction between students, professors being the boomers they are didn't get how to change slides on zoom presentations etc. You can add a curfew of 9PM to everything above. No wonder it left a lot of students in a terrible shape mentally.  
And we received no help from the uni itself, not even a guide on how to reach out for help there. The only one person who kind of tried to help was our Head of welfare who would send us some advice in a funky rainbow-ish salf-made pdf file with recommendation of a movie she watched that week and some generic advice on how to battle depression.

As a result, one of the chinese student jumped out of her window killing herself after 5 months of this treatment. 

I ended up with deep bruises on my wrist that I cut myself just to dull the pain.

And then I just left, disappointed, even though it was my dream for a long time to go to the Netherlands and start a life there. I still regret me leaving but on the other hand people there they don't give a shit about us, expats. They just want our money for their economy to prosper and once you can't provide them with it you're of no use to them.

So my advice will be to try to over come yourself in some way and find an expat just like you to talk to",,,

Nu zijn de belastingbetalende Amsterdammers, waarvan al veel geld naar sociale regelingen in de stad zelf gaat, ook nog aan het meebetalen voor een probleem verder weg op de wereld. Moeten we ook Oekra√Øne steunen of armoede in Afrika?

Lokale overheden kunnen vaak sneller handelen dan de nationale bureaucratie. Deze donatie aan Gaza laat de waarden van Amsterdam zien: solidariteit en menselijkheid. Amsterdammers willen gewoon helpen, ongeacht waar het nodig is.

I get your point about responsibilities between city and national governments, but Amsterdam has done this before with good results. Think about the aid to Haiti after the earthquake in 2010 and the support to the US after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

Local governments can often act faster than national bureaucracies. This donation to Gaza shows Amsterdam‚Äôs values: solidarity and humanity. Amsterdammers just want to help, no matter where it‚Äôs needed.

1. **European Parliament Resolution**: The European Parliament has condemned the incitement found in Palestinian and UNRWA educational materials. The resolution highlights that these materials contribute to the radicalization of individuals and calls for educational content that promotes peace and tolerance.
2. **Georg Eckert Institute Study**: A study by the Georg Eckert Institute, commissioned by the European Union, found that while Palestinian textbooks include content on human rights and tolerance, they also contain antisemitic narratives and glorifications of violence.¬†

They can, on the condition that Hamas cooperates with them, which they have refused to do. Hamas isn't preventing them from delivering aid to hospitals (except for one incident at the very start of the war) but they would most certainly prevent them from seeing the hostages if there was no agreement made beforehand.

>Hamas and RC could reach an agreement to meet somewhere (...).

Okay? Then go tell Hamas to do it. RC have pushed for an agreement to help the hostages since when they were abducted, but it generally takes two sides to agree to something, you know?

>And besides, first you said, that RC would be in danger the moment they would visit the hostages, which is crap, because they are in danger anyway the moment they cross into Gaza.

No, I said they would certainly be in danger **if there was no agreement with Hamas**. The hostages are a high priority objective for Hamas, hospitals are not. As I said, there has only been one, non-fatal incident with RC workers in Gaza at the beginning of the war, which suggests to me that they aren't awfully interested in guarding public medical facilities. 

On the other hand, sending an unauthorized convoy to a location where the hostages are being held (which is impossible, because ICRC literally don't know where they are, anyway) would pretty much be a death sentence for the workers.

In order for RC to do anything involving the hostages there has to be an agreement with Hamas first. They need to know WHERE to go and that it's NOT a suicide mission. That is all.",,,

Need to get abortion. Scared of process here and my insurance coverage,"\*I am a resident of the Netherlands and I have dutch health insurance\*

I am on a trip right now and I found out I am pregnant. I am going to fly home tomorrow as I believe I am around 2 weeks along. However, I am so confused because I cannot understand if my insurance (FBTO) covers this prescription and what this process will be like in the Netherlands. I have never even had an abortion before and I don't know where to start. Can someone please give some insight? ",61,38,Rude-Dare-7036

https://samennaardekliniek.nl/home",,,
,"Unfortunately you can't (yet) get a prescription at your own doctor. You still need to collect it directly from the abortion clinic you choose. 

You don't need a doctor's referral to a clinic, just choose the one from [this list](https://www.ngva.net/klinieken) that suits you best, and phone for an appointment. Abortion clinics are government-funded, so you will only need your insurance if you choose to seek an abortion in a hospital (usually when your health situation is more complicated than a clinic can help with).

The rule about a waiting period may have changed but there used to be a mandatory three(?) day gap between when you first call them and when you pick up your prescription. 

When you are there they will ask you some standard questions, but also ask if you are being coerced into this, and you will be invited to talk through your feelings. 

They'll do an ultrasound as well, to check your estimated gestation time and to see if there are any complicating factors.

The medication is in two parts... One to hormonally halt the pregnancy progress, and the other to trigger contractions to expel the foetus. 

This part can honestly be extremely painful, even though some women don't feel that way, likening it to heavy period cramps,I would strongly suggest you speak to your huisarts beforehand and ask for a prescription for heavy painkillers, to be taken before the second course of the meds. 

When the abortion is complete you will have a second appt at the clinic to check your physical health.

,"You can make an appointment at the abortion clinic and get an abortion without trouble. I went to my huisarts first, but they told me that I didn't niet a referral from them to get an appointment. You also don't have to pay for the abortion or the procedure, everything is payed by the government. Everything goes anonymously.

If I can offer you a little bit of unsolicited advice: if you're offered multiple options for the abortion, let them give you thorough advice and don't automatically assume the abortion pill is the easier option. Don't take it too lightly. I was one of those people who thought it was the easier option, but it gave me extreme cramps (literal labour contractions actually) and it made me bleed heavily for multiple weeks on end, to a point I needed adult diapers and was severely anemic. If I ever have to make that decision again, I would much rather get the curretage. I'm not saying this to scare you, because obviously this isn't the case for everyone, but I truly feel that the abortion pill is prescribed way too easily and without proper explanation on what you will go through.

,"Hey! I have some experience with abortion appointments here in the Netherlands!

You can make appointment directly with clinic, you don't have to go to your GP (there is no waiting period anymore). Personally I can advice Epione Clinic or Amsterdam Clinic. 

The procedure is covered by your health insurance if you have BSN/work in Netherlands and you're registered here. 

During making your appointment receptionist will ask you about your name, date of birth, last menstruation date, if you have any allergies, probably also BSN number. If you don't have ultrasound, which I assume you don't, then they may ask you to come a little earlier to check how far along you are. If you're below 12 weeks, you'll just come to the clinic for the pills. Above they are making surgical abortion under anaesthesia.

Physically assaulted and threatened at DPD/DHL package shop,"I wanted to post this as a warning to anyone living i Nieuw West that the man who manages the parcel shop Tabakzaak Lisa on Derkinderenstraat is mentally unstable and violent. 

After being treated with verbal aggression I left a one star review on the Google listing to confirm what many others in the reviews had already mentioned. I'm grateful for those other reviewers because at least thanks to them the way I was treated did not come as a shock.

However the next time I returned to the shop the man flew into a rage, screaming obscenities at me over and over and physically assaulting me by ripping my phone off its strap and pushing me out of the shop. There were other customers in the shop at the time who looked scared but they were also short women like myself so I don't blame them for not trying to step in.

Pedestrian crossings,"Hello all! I‚Äôm a tourist and I don‚Äôt want to be ignorant, so I thought I‚Äôd actually ask locals, what‚Äôs going on with pedestrian crossings here? I didn‚Äôt want to assume they are like what Australia has, but I googled the laws and apparently cars and bikes must stop when pedestrians are crossing, but when I actually walk around Amsterdam this doesn‚Äôt happen? I don‚Äôt walk in front of bikes or cars but even with a green pedestrian light they will just keep going, is there some sort of unwritten rule or is it just chaos hahaha",114,116,popepipoes

,"Just walk my friend, just walk and look angry!",,,
,"Make eye contact and walk.

Don‚Äôt stop and we‚Äôll go around you. Stop or try to avoid us and you‚Äôll likely get hit.

People won‚Äôt stop for you if you‚Äôre stood around looking confused.",,,
,"The unwritten rules that most locals adhere to are:

* Motorised vehicles (excluding electric bikes) obey the traffic laws as written (be wary of taxis and mopeds though, they often break the rules).
* Cyclists will obey traffic lights unless there is very little traffic.
* Cyclists will not stop and wait for you to cross at pedestrian crossings. You just wait until there is an opening and walk across. They will swerve around you. Keep your movement predictable so don't suddenly stop or change direction, then they will crash into you. You don't need a pedestrian crossing to cross a bike lane like this.
* Watch out for people on electric bikes and especially fatbikes. They are less likely to know the written and unwritten traffic rules and often go way faster than they should.",,,
,"At pedestrian crossings, you have right of way. Cars will stop, but many cyclists however won't. Instead, they will swerve around you if there's enough space. When this happens, be sure to just continue to cross the street at the same pace, and don't panic, sprint, or make  juke-moves from left to right, etc.

I've seen many near misses in traffic with tourists who turn into Muhammad Ali because a cyclist (12 km/h,  braking distance of 2m) biked in their general direction",,,
,"Bikes do not stop, and I feel like the last couple of years an increasing amount of cars keeps driving as well (the large majority still stops though!). 

As far as bikes go, if there are just one or two pedestrians I‚Äôll go around you. Do not expect me to stop. If you wait I will go, if you walk I will slow down a little and go behind. Main thing is to make a decision and go for it, don‚Äôt hesitate. And whatever you do, please don‚Äôt change your mind and stand still in the middle of the road.",,,
,"The reasoning behind this is that it takes less effort for a pedestrian to stop than someone on a bike who has to slow down, step off the bike, step on again and accelerate. Every Dutch person rides a bike so we all understand this situation so it is basically socially accepted. 

You are right that legally pedestrians have the way or right. 
In reality tho, it‚Äôs most of the time the other way around for reasons i just mentioned. 

Especially on busy bikelanes (Amsterdam). 

In rural areas or less busy bikelanes, often the bikes let the pedestrians go first.",,,
,"technically, ped has right of way.

however if it‚Äôs a lot of bikes, one or two stopping suddenish for one pedestrian at the front of the pack will cause a bike pile up, so you‚Äôre probably best waiting for a break, signalling to oncoming riders and scurrying your ass across that path.",,,
,"I don't know if this is mentioned already, but if you walk on a crossing, most importantly: DON'T STOP. You have the right off way, and these annoying bikes know it. They mostly aim at the opening you create behind you when you walk. I see most accidents happen when a pedestrian gets scared and stops. This way, the opening behind you suddenly closes  and you get in an accident.",,,

Bikes should stop as well but they don't, unless you are with a stroller/toddler.",,,
,"When a road has a pedestrian light with zebracross, there is always a traffic light for the cars. And the cars always stop, unless the roads are completely empty, there is a chance some will still drive through red.

Yes, there are roads with zebracross and no pedestrian light. And it often happens that cars don't stop, when pedestrians always have the priority.

Bikers are just rude and they will never stop, even if you hesitate. But that's a conversation on it self.",,,
,The secret is to just walk - you are used to pedestrian crossings on car centric roads - you're expecting traffic to stop completely - locals know that cyclists will slow down and steer around them rather than come to a complete standstill (and lose all forward momentum).,,,

,"In theory, you have the right of way. In practice, it will only determine who pays for your funeral.",,,
,I find that bikes often slow just enough so you can pass in front ONLY if you show active intention to cross and look at the cyclist. Stopping completely is really uncomfortable for cyclists.,,,

,"It's the opposite of Australia. Life here is more about being aware and working together. Keep your eyes open, make eye contact, and flow through like an adult who doesn't need constant rules and regulations to live your life (source: Am Australian, lived in NL half my life. )",,,
,"As a Dutchie I just cross the road. Usually everyone stops. Sometimes it‚Äôs almost an emergency stop, but that‚Äôs not my problem. It‚Äôs not that I run over the crosswalk, I walk over it in an average pace, so they had every chance to stop earlier.",,,
,"When I‚Äôm not on my bicycle I never have issues as a pedestrian here, but also have lived in Amsterdam for 10+ years. I think it just takes some time to get used to! Much like walking in Tokyo / Shibuya crossing needs getting used to, walking around Amsterdam is the same..",,,
,"Cyclists in the Netherlands read eachother's body language. Most of it subconsciously. They read pedestrians body language too.

,"They do have to stop if you show clear indication of wanting to cross at the crosswalk, and don't you love how ambiguous this is? So there's a bit of bluff involved, and they see if they can get away with ignoring. Also, you're the one that's getting hurt so it's pretty senseless to take it too far.

So, some practical guidelines that are NOT rules, may even break the official rules and will not help you in a court of law, but still things that can be of use:

* if there are enough gaps in traffic, just aim for the gaps. If you can cross behind bikes or cars it's just so much easier. If it's not on a crosswalk or not straight but you can see there is no traffic, you're usually good. The roads where you really shouldn't stand out. (Wide roads, high speeds, be careful of trams and buses)
* check the traffic situation a bit before you're actually crossing. It makes no sense to jump in front of traffic that can't avoid you, and crosswalks don't protect against that. So it usually it helps to spot a gap that's enough for others to spot you (if that makes sense) and then commit to it, and be clear about what you're intending to do. 
* cyclists will just swerve and try to go around you rather than brake, especially if there are no hard edges or tram tracks.
* people can get upset, but that may or may not be because you did things wrong. 
* be careful with people that are glued to their phones, they are not paying attention 

All in all it's a balancing act, not entirely chaos, still quite chaotic.",,,
,[removed],,,
,"There‚Äôs usually a gap in cars pretty often. I find that the people requesting to walk are usually looking at the gap in cars that is nearly behind you if you are driving, they usually wait for the opening and then start walking. You only have to wait for a moment and you get cars through. But yeah if there‚Äôs a big gap and you start to cross they will stop. This is helped by good eye contact, intention and the fact that roads here are at a much more human scale. The maximum speed is 30km/h, enough time for people to acknowledge each other and to minimize wrong moves or accident damage. Compared to the US, where you are lucky if you can find a place to cross, people will look at you weirdly anyway because you are not in a car. And the rate of speed in the US and other parts of the world are usually much higher, which decreases the verbal handshake you can do with strangers on the street, lowers reaction time, and increases the amount of damage a vehicle can do in a crash.",,,

,"Im going to speak for myself here hahah; but it is true, you have the right to cross a zebra crossing but as the comments say, make eye contact. Lots of people just go ( i make myself guilty of doing so too every now and then, but if you have a green light and if im not in a hurry i will always try to stop for people on the crossing road!) oh btw what i notice lots of people ( mostly tourists) do, is just randomly crossing without looking left and right. So quick tip; ALWAYS look both ways before crossing. This avoids ugly accidents that might happen :)) other then that; enjoy Amsterdam!",,,
,"Helps if you cycle a bit yourself, then you'll understand it from both perspectives. Just don't try doing it in Amsterdam centraal to begin with (especially if like many recent arrivals, you've not ridden a bike in years). I think a mistake people often make is that they stand a few feet back from the crossing, looking timid and indecisive, and then they get on Reddit complaining that cyclists don't let them cross. 

When you do that, you give the impression you're not sure if you need to be on the other side of the road or not, and no one wants to slow down and lose momentum for someone who isn't actually going to cross. If you did this every time there was someone awkwardly standing at the edge of a crossing, you'd never get anywhere, and half the people you stop for wouldn't even cross over anyway. 

  
You shouldn't necessarily just confidently walk out and expect everyone to accommodate you though because there are various cyclist subtypes that are prone to not stopping. People on fat bikes go way faster than you might expect, and there are various types of rental bike that indicate someone is a tourist or from out of town, and they might behave unpredictably. 

After a while you'll figure out the chaos, and you'll only get hit once or twice a year outside centraal station.",,,

,"Pedestrians always have right of way, but bikes are the group of road users that do not abide to this. This is not you, it's the cyclists.

Without going into too much detail and nuance why this is, remember to be careful when crossing. You can take your pedestrian right, and you wont be in the wrong, but you can get hurt because a cyclist will think you will yield to them. It's not worth getting into a crash.",,,
,"In my understanding (coming from Utrecht and often being in Amsterdam) there is an unwritten rule that pedestrian crossings (zebrapad) often get ignored by cyclists. Cars will often stop, cyclists won't. Especially crossings that only cross a small cycling path.

In my opinion the crossings create confusion, because cyclists don't adhere to them. Which makes pedestrians not fully trust them when they cross. Making it unsure if the pedestrian will cross or wait. I personally realized that as a cyclist I also started to ignore some of the crossings. Because if I would stop I would be doing something out of the norm on the road. This would lead to cyclists behind me crashing into me and pedestrians still not always trusting the situation. It can actually be more dangerous for both.

Pedestrian crossings with traffic lights are a different breed though, those should be respected. Often you need to take an assertive stance when crossing. But always take in mind your own safety.",,,
,"On zebras you technically have right of way, but cyclists won't stop for you. It's best to wait a bit for a gap in the bike traffic and cross over then, just make sure you walk at a steady pace and don't make random sudden moves so the cyclists can walk around you.",,,

Make eye contact and just keep walking (within reason), bikes will 'lift' and make sure you can cross the bicycle lane. 

If you walk up to a crossing without looking, stop at the crossing, and look to the left, it's to late. I will stop the 'lift' and continue cycling. Because the only way to let you pass at this point, is to make a full stop.",,,
,"Obviously use your judgement, the laws are just there to determine fault in the event of an accident. But it‚Äôs much better to avoid an accident in the first place.",,,
,Apart from all else said I just wanted to add that it is not 'chaos'. It's very clear to other local road users what is happening. You not understanding a system or what's happening does not make it chaos.,,,
,"Unfortunately Amsterdam kind of sucks for all types of traffic. There‚Äôs hardly any space for pedestrians, the vast majority of cycle paths js way to narrow for the amount of bikes it needs to facilitate, and its not great for cars either. 

Also, Amsterdam is world champion at stupid right of way situations. 

Evidence: Weesperplein. You have right of way from other bikes after a super busy crossing (weesperstraat/sarphatistraat) while biking on a path that is basically a cycle highway, and suddenly, you need to give way to pedestrians on the pedestrian crossing. Its just plain dangerous because the cyclists you cross only have to give way to you and don‚Äôt see the pedestrian.

Or any bike crossing at Wibautstraat, where you just risked your life to cross just in time due to the insanely short green for bikes. You have right of way from the bikes that follow wibautstraat on the other side, but you have to give way to pedestrians, thereby risking bikers on wibautstraat crashing into you and bikers behind you to suffer the  same fate or be overrun by cars on Wibautstraat. 

I do feel for pedestrians. However I make the flash risk assessment every single bike trip at least 3-4 times. I stop when I am not risking to be overrun by cars or other bikes, or endanger bikers behind me, but if I have to choose a collision with one of those or a pedestrian that I probably will not hit, the pedestrian is waiting.

I spend a lot of time thinking about an alternative, but I came to the conclusion that this is probably an ‚Äòembrace the chaos‚Äô type of situation. There‚Äôs just not enough space to get it right for all traffic.

That being said: there‚Äôs a special place in hell for people on bikes (especially big bikes like bakfietsen or fatbikes) that go against the flow of traffic/on the wrong side of the road. Biking, walking or driving in Amsterdam is already an assault on one‚Äôs cognitive abilities. Please stop making it worse.",,,
,I almost got run over twice and ive been here for a little over 24h lmao. I rented a bike and relived my childhood memoriez of biking around but it seems pretty dangerous not gonna lie. And it doesnt help that the bike is also shit cause its a rental (king of bikes),,,
,"I'm an Aussie and been here about seven years.
Bikes are supposed to stop but there's weak, almost non-existent enforcement of any traffic laws for bikes.
It's partly because of the sheer amount of cyclists and also that it just doesn't seem to be a priority for the police.
The will sporadically check some ebikes and scooters for speed limiters or if people have tail lights on their bikes but that's about it, even that is very rare.
My advice is just stare them down when you cross.",,,

That's your problem. You should.",,,
,"The way it goes here is very simple: traffic rules apply to cars and other motorized vehicles (ignore electric bikes for now).

,"Bikes must stop but they often don't. I think it's because the expectation is that the pedestrians will wait.

,"Yep, cars will stop - bikes usually not.

Always check, try to make quick eye contact with an approaching bike.

You don't want them to do a full break (might even be dangerous if the bike path is really busy). 

So usually you wait for close bikes to pass, otherwise they will break slightly or drive around you.

Although you technically have the right of way, insisting on it will just cause more dangerous situations and people will be pissed at you.

And usually you just need to wait a few seconds tops, and being pedantic about it just causes more stress for everyone.",,,

The hierarchy model which gives pedestrians right of way can only work if the law is enforced. It is there as a safety precaution; a pedestrian will move at less speed than a bicycle or motorised vehicle. Anything that moves faster than a pedestrian can cause injury to them. You do have to question whether cyclists have taken any road proficiency test or if they have just bought a bicycle and have no idea about road laws. Do cyclists understand that a bicycle is a road vehicle, and therefore they legally have to abide by road laws? Lack of education, lack of actual people who have taken a road proficiency tests, lack of enforcement. This is not just a problem for Amsterdam, but also the same problem in Paris and London. Something has got to happen before more pedestrians are injured. It's not great for tourism either as word will get out that Amsterdam, Paris and London are not safe places for pedestrians.",,,

Geluidoverlast ,"Lieve mensen

Door ziekte ben ik inmiddels 2 jaar compleet beperkt in al mijn doen en laten. Een erg vervelend verschijnsel is dat ik heel gevoelig ben geworden voor geluid.

Nu woon ik in het centrum boven een cafe (er zitten een paar verdiepingen tussen) en merk dat ik het niet meer trek qua geluidsoverlast. Een groot terras met schreeuwende lallende mensen wat elke dag tot in de late uurtjes doorgaat. Ik gun iedereen hun plezier, maar het schreeuwen en (vrij overdreven) hard lachen is iets wat bij mij inmiddels door merg en been gaat. Oordoppen draag ik standaard elke avond, maar het lawaai hoor je er helaas vaak gewoon doorheen. Ik vind het lastig om hier iets aan te veranderen, je kan moeilijk naar de mensen toegaan en vragen of ze even wat zachter kunnen doen. 

Ik weet niet hoe ik dit kan aanpakken, het is inmiddels zo erg dat ik er elk weekend om moet huilen, omdat ik weet dat ik dan pas rond 4 uur in een redelijke stilte naar bed kan gaan. 
Heeft iemand misschien tips of idee√´n hoe ik dit probleem evt aan zou kunnen pakken? 
Ik waardeer het ontzettend,

Groetjes",3,31,ananasinblik
,Verhuizen,,,
,"Ze zullen daar gewoon een vergunning voor hebben, dus daar kan je niets tegen doen. In het centrum is ook wel een hele slechte plek als je gevoelig bent voor geluid, en al helemaal boven een cafe. Je enige echte oplossing is om te verhuizen.",,,
,Verhuizen vrees ik. In Amsterdam Centrum bij een caf√© zal het nooit rustig worden.,,,
,"Als je echt heel erg aan de plek bent gehecht zou je kunnen overwegen om je woning zo geluidsdicht mogelijk te laten isoleren en toevoer van frisse lucht bij de achtergevel te halen. Dit is ingrijpend en waarschijnlijk vrij kostbaar, maar niet onmogelijk en direct een kans om je woning extreem energiezuinig te maken.

De andere optie is helaas zoeken naar een rustigere plek om te wonen. Er zijn voldoende buurten zonder cafe's en een recenter gebouwde woning kan je problemen behoorlijk doen afnemen. Als kun je ook daar lawaaiige buren of een lawaaiige omgeving treffen.",,,
,"Verhuizen inderdaad. Je kan het proberen aan te vechten, maar je gaat dat niet winnen. En je kunt met noise-cancelling headsets gaan rondlopen, oordoppen indoen of wat anders maar dat is symptoombestrijding. De bron is simpelweg dat je in het centrum van een grote stad woont boven horeca. Daar komt nu eenmaal geluid vandaan.

Heeeeeel misschien kun je je huis laten isoleren op een bepaalde manier, maar ik betwijfel of dat haalbaar is. Ik ben zelf ook geluidsgevoelig en weet hoe rot het is. Ik ging vaak zoveel mogelijk naar vrienden of ergens anders naartoe, maar dat is geen permanente oplossing. Het enige wat bij mij hielp is verhuizen.

Misschien is het mogelijk een woningruil te doen? Er zijn genoeg mensen die een plek in het centrum van Amsterdam wel zien zitten. Misschien past Amsterdam Noord of Duivendrecht meer bij je? Misschien kan je het in je voordeel omzetten om ergens te gaan wonen waar het juist rustig is omdat het afgelegen en daarmee onbemind is? Misschien de havenbuurt van Zaandam? Dan ben je met een electrische fiets toch redelijk snel in Amsterdam en woon je redelijk afgelegen?",,,
,"erg vervelend. Ook ik  lijd aan hyperacusis en ben zelf overgestapt van oordopjes naar het over ear oorbescherming. Die dingen die bouwvakkers ook hebben. Daarnaast kan je mischien ook een actief koptelefoon proberen. Deze geeft qls het ware een tegengeluid.

Daarnaast mischien kijken naar naar isolatie en dubbel glas als dat niet al is gebeurd",,,
,Dit klinkt als een relatie waar de koek op is. Jij en de locatie zijn niet meer een goede match. Om te voorkomen dat door de situatie je gemoedstoestand nog erger wordt zou ik kijken of je kan verhuizen.,,,
,Ruilen? Woon verder van t centrum met een lift en 3 slaapkamers üòÇ,,,
,"Voordat je gaat verhuizen, zou ik eens een white noise apparaat proberen. Je kunt dat ook met je telefoon doen, maar een apparaat geeft fijner geluid, in mijn ervaring. Ik slaap ook af en toe op een luidruchtige plek met veel uitgaanspubliek en hiermee slaap ik echt heel goed :)",,,
,"Ik ben de stad uit verhuisd doordat ik meerdere buren had in het appartementencomplex die regelmatig feestjes gaven. 3-4 nachten per week een feestje tot 6 uur, de verhuurder die niks doet, de politie die uiteindelijk ook niks kan doen. Toen maar de oplossing bij mijzelf gezocht en dus verhuisd naar een klein vrijstaand huisje in een dorp een half uur bij Amsterdam vandaan.

Soms is de enige manier om controle te pakken door de situatie te veranderen. Hoe shit het ook is. Want ik hoor gewoon in een stad te wonen. Echt heerlijk, de mensen om mij heen, alle leuke restaurantjes, makkelijk even een bioscoopje of theater pakken, leuke parkjes, even de Febo in of iets laten thuisbezorgen. Maar ik trek het niet qua geluid. En nu rijd ik maar gewoon regelmatig in het weekend naar de stad toe.",,,
,"Ik kan ook niet tegen te veel geluid. Paar jaar terug naar een saaie woonwijk in een saaie kutstad verhuisd. Beste besluit ooit.

Verhuis lekker naar de provincie, je gezondheid en geluk is het waard!",,,
,Verhuizen naar andere stad,,,
,"Los van dat ik denk dat verhuizen in jouw situatie goed voor je zou zijn: probeer eens white noise icm oordopjes. Je kunt hier een speciaal white noise apparaat voor kopen en goede oordopjes aanschaffen maar het kan ook heel budget. Zelf speel ik white noise af op spotify (‚Äúbaby sleep miracle 8 hours | pink noise calms crying baby, colic‚Äù heet mijn favoriet maar de keuze is reuze) en heb ik van die goedkope oranje oordopjes. Werkt voor mij heel goed!",,,
,Heeft u al geprobeerd om oordoppen te gebruiken met Noise cancelling? Samsung Earbuds Pro 2 heb ik zelf en die werken heel goed. Ik zou u echt aanraden om die te gebruiken. Veel sterkte! ‚ù§Ô∏è,,,
,"Koop oordoppen van wasbolletjes; die werken het beste en blokkeren zeker het geluid dat jij ervaart.

Als dat niet genoeg zou zijn, kun je een speaker aanzetten met white noise, of een stromende waterval of iets dergelijks om het geluid dat doorkomt te maskeren.

Als dat niet genoeg is; zorg voor driedubbel glas en betere isolatie in je slaapkamer.

Als dat niet genoeg is, dan kun je beter verhuizen. Slaap is cruciaal voor je gezondheid, functioneren en een lang leven",,,
,"Je woont in het centrum van de hoofdstad. Amsterdam is ook nog eens een mega populaire toeristenbestemming. Wat verwacht je?

Je bent niet meer geschikt om in het centrum te wonen, helaas.

Je zou nog op maat gemaakte oordopjes kunnen proberen (of eerste gewoon verschillende merken goedkope/standaard oordopjes proberen; ik slaap ook met oordopjes sinds ik geluidsoverlast heb van buren (ik rebruik Moldex ""spark plug"" oordopjes, die werken voor mij het beste)).

Maar ik denk dat je moet concluderen dat je moet verhuizen. Een vriendin van mij woonde aan de hoofdstraat in een veel kleinere stad en had daar ook elke donderdag- vrijdag- en zaterdagavond erg veel last van geschreeuw, gelal, gejoel, etc. Dat is gewoon hoe het is. Daar kan je niets aan veranderen. Als je rust wil, dan moet je niet in een centrum wonen. Klaar.

Dus, ik zou verhuizen. Misschien ook nog voordelen, bovenop de rust, bv meer ruimte, een lagere huur, een tuin(tje), meer gemeeschapsgevoel met buren, etc. It's not all bad.

How to find housing in Amsterdam without selling a kidney and piss off your landlord in the process.,"***TL;DR : You can screw your landlord on the rent price instead of him/her screwing you***

Hi

I am Shane. I ruin landlord's lives for a living.

Like about 6 million people in NL, I rent my home from a landlord. While most of that six million are living in low-income housing offered by Woningcorporaties like Eigen Haard or Stagenoot, the rest of us have to rent from private landlords and companies out to squeeze as much money as possible from the limited supply of housing available.

While some people are content to pay [1000 euro](https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/02/cost-of-renting-a-room-in-amsterdam-nears-e1000-per-month/) per month for a room in Amsterdam, I work with tenants to help get them living in a whole apartment for less than that.  This is possible because the same rules that govern how high the rent price in those low-income homes offered by the Woningcorporaties, also apply to the homes on the private market.

The maximum rent price of a home is governed by the Points system: an objective calculation method for determining the **maximum reasonable rent price** for a home. A home gets points for:

* Size in sqm
* Energy label
* Property Value
* Amount of outdoor space
* Kitchen and bathroom facilities

The more points it gets, the higher the maximum rent price and if it scores above 147 pts (2024) only then can the landlord charge whatever price he wants.

The issue is that many landlords and estate agents knowingly overprice small or low quality home well above the maximum reasonable rent price in the hopes of earning an extra buck, particularly from Expats and international students who dont know these laws.

Take [this place](https://www.pararius.nl/appartement-te-huur/amsterdam/a5aa34a7/jacob-van-lennepkade) for example

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iyxqiwygpl8d1.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a655e667f83135e600fc6e767d9fb0ba911ed5c

This 50sqm apartment in the center has an asking price of **2200 euro per month**. The energy label is suppose to be a D but in actual fact this apartment has no valid label (0pts). When you add up all the points for this place, the **maximum reasonable rent price is closer to 800 euro per month.**

This means that the landlord is likely to be overcharging any tenants who move into this apartment, even accounting for the service costs and furnishings. (*Edit, never trust a real estate agent with the ""expat"" in their title, they always seem to overcharge like this*)

""***well thats great Shane, you big-balled sex machine""*** \*you might be thinking ""\****What the hell am I suppose to do with this information? If I complain about the price during the viewing, they will just give the place to someone else who will pay it""***

Thats true....but who says you have to say anything?

Article 7:249 of the Dutch Civil code gives the tenant the right to ask the Huurcommissie (The rent tribunal) to test the reasonableness of the rent price of their home within 6 to 30 months, depending on whether you have a permanent or temporary contract.

Pay 25 euros, fill out the form and have an inspector come to your home to measure and calculate the points score for your apartment. If you are proven right and the rent is unreasonable, your landlord will be compelled to lower your rent retroactively to the beginning of your contract.

When I started doing this two years ago, I expected that getting rent reduction of >400 euro was possible every so often...maybe a few times per year but I routinely file cases where tenants score a 700 euro per month rent reduction. Case like this also pop up often on the Huurcommissies Judgement [page](https://hip.huurcommissie.nl/#/uitspraken)

&#x200B;

[This case \(not mine\) nearly got a 1000 euro rent reduction](https://preview.redd.it/dn8mdgripl8d1.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=df51b81bc841acc001c312b7dffdc8dec5576ccc)

And amazingly one tenant got a reduction from 1950 euro down to 95 euro per month

&#x200B;

**all of this was possible because the tenant went to the Huurcommissie....**

On my subreddit r/Rentbusters I repost ads from housing websites for homes I strongly suspect can be 'busted' at the Huurcommissie,

I advocate a policy of only applying for homes that you know you can get a reduction on, rather than trying to apply for the lower priced homes that will inevidably draw 100s of applications.

If you live in a rental home that you suspect is overpriced and want to find out for sure, you can easily check this yourself using any number of calculators, links below.

[Use this one if you have your own toilet and kitchen (takes 30 mins  - most accurate)](https://checkjeprijs.huurcommissie.nl/en/onderwerpen/huurprijs-en-punten/nieuwe-huurprijscheck/rent-check-independent-living-space)

[use this one if you rent a room (takes 5 mins)](https://checkjeprijs.huurcommissie.nl/en/onderwerpen/huurprijs-en-punten/nieuwe-huurprijscheck/rent-check-dependent-living-space)

If you just want to do a quick check or dont have access to measuring tape you can try my own [beautiful and fast calculator](https://rentcalculator.onrender.com/).

**Disclaimer:** There are risks involved with housing hunting/busting in general.

* Your landlord wont like you for one thing and some landlords react very badly to an inspector showing up threatening to cut profits on their [investment as this buster found out](https://new.reddit.com/r/Rentbusters/comments/1cm9zuf/utrecht_courtesy_of_utinyboii_a_landlord_explode/). Intimidation and violence is not uncommon but it is sometimes possible to do this AFTER you leave. the home.
* The points estimation I or you do is based off information from ads and measurement: occasionally the landlord may know something about the place that we dont that could increase the points with the biggest culprit being renovation costs (2pts per 10k invested)
* The landlord sometimes appeals the Huurcommissie judgement at the sub-district court. This can be financially offset by getting **rechtstandverzekering (wonen & consumer module)** from your bank **before** starting the case (preferably at least 3 months).
* This procedure can take many months and be stressful, particularly if the landlord resorts to intimidation/lawyers

They pay a high mortgage cause they keep a system intact of supply and demand.

Why does a person need to own 10-20 properties. 
This then takes houses off the market for new starters.

And using houses as an investment is a risk.
And investments can lose value.
So i highly disagree with people taking the landlord's side.

The roof was fixed but took like a month of calling and messaging. 

Me and my flatmate paid 1800 euros in rent.  Then when the contract finishes we asked hey can we extend?

Because it would no longer be as lucrative for investors to buy properties with the purpose of renting. Meaning first time buyers wouldn‚Äôt be competing with investors. 

The big cities have since also introduced rules that dictate people have to live in a place themselves for at least 4 (I think?) years before even being allowed to rent. 

Unfortunately, it has done nothing to stabilise property prices. Meaning it‚Äôs still pretty impossible to buy if you don‚Äôt already own.",,,
,"I guess this might be a way to regulate indirectly the buying market.

By making rentals a worse investement for investors, the buying pressure would be smaller, and more homeowner might decide to sell their second house/appartments. In the short-term it could be a good thing, as it could flood the market with more homes, and lessen their price.

However long-term it might actually be detrimental... less investors wanting to buy to rent, actually mean less pressure to construct.

,"Na, we can't be shortsighted. Perhaps you do, but you may or may not have any idea how often people that suddenly ""move up"" in life reach towards rental units as a way of social mobility. I work with South Africans, probably at least 100, and almost every single one of them that I spoke to owns at least one property and is renting any others back home. Actually, our boss from an Eastern European country has maybe 6 rental units in Spain/other parts of Europe (maybe just Spain, can't remember). 

My own family had some in the past, and you're right now that I remember we did hold onto one property for a long time instead of renting, but it was complicated (nothing to do with the property or any laws, just family members not caring). 

To try to wrap this up and make my point as I'm sadly long winded even when I type, my favorite solution to helping solve any housing crisis caused partially by rental units is to make renting hell for the renter. Regulations wise or what have you. My other favorite solution: stop moving out at 18. Stay home as long as possible. 

Realistically, we can't have it all. More realistically, if we don't make renting an easy way to snowball your way into fortune, we're all going to eat it later on (or our kids will).

,"There are also plenty of other considerations when buying.

I think many people in the recent low interest years had quite the naive way of buying (suboptimal) real estate with the thinking of 'oh I just pay rent into my own pocket'.

Sure, if you know you'll be living there for a really long time it's worth it.

But I've seen many people who bought an apartment and outgrew their investment when they for example moved together with a partner and a child popped up, suddenly they needed a home office, got relocated, changed jobs etc.

Or suddenly they had to drop 20-30k on some kind of investment in either their apartment or the building.

,"Firstly, if you enforce regulations, rentals will get more available for the renters, which will solve the problem partially.

Then, if someone would decide that being a leech doesn't fit their taste anymore and sells it, it would either mean selling to a private person or to a corporation. Let's examine the potential futures for the property: being rented out under the enforced regulations and, as such, opened up for the renters; being actually lived in.

Excluding the extra-rich people, who'd buy a previously rental property to live in it occasionally (because they are small in number), the ones to live in it would be the people, who wanted to buy a property, but weren't able to.
Now, with the supply increasing demand will decrease and such people will be able to do so. Most likely, people, who would have cash on hand for mortgage/purchase weren't living in their parents' basement, but instead were renting. So, the property they were renting, is opened up for the renters.

*Warning Disturbing Pictures* Animal Neglect/Abuse,"The question : Who do I call to report animal abuse/neglect? Already tried DOA but they were no help, I was extremely disappointed with how they went about this cat I brought in. 
The story: 
There is a cat in my neighborhood which has been around for almost a year. It has always been in pretty bad shape; lots of skin issues (open sores, missing fur patches), too skinny, dirty fur etc. She hangs out all day under cars and recently I saw her looking especially bad and decided to bring her to the DOA in hopes they would fix her up. Turns out she was microchipped and actually belonged to someone (shocking to me since she is clearly not being taken care of). I expressed this concern to DOA that she wasn‚Äôt being well cared for and what do they do? Their response: surrender her back to her owner. I‚Äôm convinced they didn‚Äôt even look her over. The owner was defensive, claiming she has a special food allergy and ‚Äúrequested we don‚Äôt feed her‚Äù even though we don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve worked with cats before and I know food allergies and how they manifest. If she has a food allergy, there is no way her skin problems are just from strangers feeding her, they are too far progressed. And also if she has such bad food allergies why are you allowing her to lie under a car all day where anyone can come by and feed her? ADDITIONALLY maybe people wouldn‚Äôt be feeding her if she didn‚Äôt look so malnourished??? Anyways that‚Äôs my rant. I will include pics of her bad spots, but they don‚Äôt do it full justice, she has lots of scarring and missing fur from sores in the past. Who can I call to report this abuse?

As you can see in the pictures there are open wounds. The owner says its a food allergy? Interesting considering the cat is looking that way for a year...you would think if it was a proper owner and the cat got the care it deserves that it would not be looking like that for over a year.

If that cat is loved it wouldn't look like that and people can say that they might not have found the right treatment yet...to that I say if that is the case why in the hell is the cat let outside with wounds like that and the chance of people feeding it if the reason is a food allergy?

,"I don't really want to help you because wht you want to do (keeping the cat away from owner, without knowing why she has the sores in the first place) is not something I condone.


We might have lost a perfectly healthy outside cat this way too, (no microchips at the time) and I still believe that it's a shitty thing to do.


I also hate that you assume the cat doesn't have a choice. Maybe she can enter her house at any time through a cat door, and chooses to be outside.


Ir maybe the cat won't even go inside without a serious fight. Happens a lot with teen strays that get domesticated enough to be touched, but not enough to be fully comfortable with humans. In that case you also won't be able to keep the cat inside for long. The cat will escape.



But there is a way to help the cat and not take it from its owner: talk to the owners, tell them you want to help and not add problems, ask how to help.


Maybe the family is struggling and cannot buy enough food for the cat (but, slim cat is an happy cat, and the cat in your photos is not malnourished, just slim). Prescription diets are EXPENSIVE. Maybe the owner will appreciate you buying them some of her cat food, regularly.


Maybe they need a vet bill footed to check again how the cat is doing, or some other forms of support.


And maybe the neighborhood should really stop feeding her for her to get better (reminding you that you are going against the owner request here, uh).


If you really, really want to feed the cat, give her only her prescription food, nothing else.",,,

Do you have a pet right now?



If you have a pet, how fast will you surrender it to a shelter if you lose your current job? Immediately? Right after the unemployment benefits end? Do you have enough savings to deal with an expensive emergency for your pet while you are unemployed? For how long?



What if the next job comes to a significant pay cut and you don't manage to find a better paying one for a while? Will you surrender your pet then?


Or, what if the cost of living increases so much for you that you are barely able to afford your pet (by your standards) and then you find out she needs a prescription diet? Will you surrender her?


What if you have kids?


Also, you completely disregarded my comments about 1) this cat not wanting to go inside (forcing her inside would be abuse in my eyes) and 2) the cat being fed her correct diet in the right quantity at home, and the neighbors ignoring that and feeding her not prescription diet food.",,,
,"Probably not, try to call animal services too see if they can take em away from the current owner.",,,
,"Why not? Everywhere around Europe cats roam freely. Don't be stupid, they're animals.",,,
,There is absolutely no way this cat is being treated at a vet. She never looks better just progressively worse. Anyone with eyes and brain would know this cat is being neglected if they saw her.,,,
,"Yeah so it seems reasonable for you to assume that if there is an owner who claims the cat, they are incredibly neglectful at best.",,,
,"Oh yeah you're totally right. There is not one single solution to a food allergy. No special food no nothing. Also, lets just not give a fuck about any animal who looks like its in pain for over a year if it has an owner because you know...it might be this it might be that.  It might be actually suffering  but lets come up with all the excuses just in case its not getting neglected. 

I hope that if you see a child completely bruised up for a whole year  you have a different view and will actually try and do something or is it like...they might fall from the stairs every week, they might fight a lot with friends, they might this or they might that. This is the reason why animals and children die under care of owners/parents because they don't have a voice and people like you come up with every excuse under the sun to not interfere.",,,

,"Wel hele broden blijven kopen (want halve zijn duurder) maar ze voortaan in de vriezer bewaren (ik gooide tot voor kort ook halve broden weg voor ik hier mee begon) De avond van te voren een paar sneetjes eruit halen en je hebt 's ochtends je brood klaar liggen (kan ook snel ff voor 30 sec in de magnetron alleen heb je dan wel warm/nat brood, maar vind ik persoonlijk niet erg) ook kan in de koelkast bewaren ipv in de kast helpen om beschimmeling uit te stellen.

Al je huishoudelijke/schoonmaak spullen voortaan bij de Action halen tenzij je echt een specifieke voorkeur voor een bepaald (duurder) product hebt.

Albert Heijn vind ik persoonlijk belachelijk onnodig duur voor heel veel wekelijkse boodschappen, Jumbo eigenlijk ook alleen kom ik daar niet vaak genoeg, Plus heb ik geen ervaring mee, ik zou als het je lukt eerder naar de Vomar of de Dirk gaan, scheelt echt veel imo.

Qua recepten zou ik kijken naar een paar basis idee√´n uit eenzetten zoals rijst met kip en (diepvries)groente of gewoon een simpel avg'tje zodat je dan eindeloos kan vari√´ren want je kan je kip in 1000 en 1 verschillende marinades klaar maken en de ene groente past weer beter met het andere vlees en dan wat bakjes aanschaffen zodat je wat porties kunt invriezen want ook zijn de grootverpakking van vlees, groente en aardappels vaak goedkoper in aanschaf dan de kleinere verpakking.

- Makelaars, what to expect, what makes a difference between a good and and a bad one, etc.. (maybe even recommendation for someone, perhaps via DM?)
- Taxes and expenses when buying the house, how much money should we prepare upfront, which banks are nice for credit
- Any tax benefits we should be aware of
- How to best inspect the house for structural issues/leaks and ensure we don't get ""scammed""?
- Advice on bidding (looks like it's a bit complicated here?)

After doing the process I wouldn‚Äôt pay again. If you do choose one, do a lot of research. Important things to know - you cannot borrow more than the ‚Äúworth of the house‚Äù so be careful over bidding if you don‚Äôt have money saved. For example - a seller is asking ‚Ç¨350,000- you love the house and over bid to ‚Ç¨380,000 and win the bid. A taxation person comes and values the house at ‚Ç¨360,000. You must have the difference yourself and cannot borrow it in a mortgage. If you‚Äôre under 35, it‚Äôs your first home and under ‚Ç¨500,000 you are exempt from a tax in the kostenkooper.

* Aankoop makelaar (to buy): its useful, but not necessarry. Maybe if you lose a few bids, try to get one via friends or colleagues with recommendation. Make sure to agree on a fixed price, not a percentage of the price. You can DM me.
* Get a hypotheek adviseur. A lot of stuff to pay, but in the end a lot of tax advantages.
* Good to know: if you buy a place for 400k (just an example), you will need at least 10k to 15k (tax, hypotheek services, taxation, etc). But.. appraisers / taxateurs will just put the price of the house on 415 and you can finance it all with the mortage.
* Inspection: get one to do it for you, costs around 300-500 euro. Sometimes the selling party does this already for you .
* Advice on bidding: know how far you can go, with or without conditions of financing / inspections.",,,

Spat on face by kid on Fatbike,"I can‚Äôt believe this actually happened to me‚Ä¶

I was cycling home with a bag full of groceries eating my AH pain au chocolat and 2 kids on a fatbike turned onto my street (going the opposite direction), saw me, and spat on my face. The spit went into my left eye so I had to try to wipe it off as fast as possible.

I was so shocked and was trying to wipe the spit off my face but when I looked back they were nowhere to be found. This all happened within ‚âà5-10 seconds. 

I called the police and provided a description of the kid but they told me they could only record this incident and that there was nothing much they could do about it. I asked them if they could check CCTV footage as I‚Äôve given them the exact time and street that it happened on, but they said they don‚Äôt have resources to watch the footage to track them down.

Even though I washed my left eye right after reaching home, it feels a bit itchy now so I hope it‚Äôs not infected or anything‚Ä¶ god knows what was in his mouth before he spat on me.

I‚Äôm making this post to partially vent because nothing can be done to the kids, I truly hope this changes soon either judicially or through better parenting. But also for my experience to act as a cautionary tale to everyone. I was just a random target they chose and so can you. Please be wary of kids on fatbikes, seems like they can just speed off after all the shit that they do and get 0 repercussions.

This incident happened on Bestev√¢erstraat (Bos en Lommer) at around 17:10 today.",346,274,vicsause
,"Sorry to hear about your experience. It doesn't hurt to give the GP a quick call on Monday morning to get an opinion on the matter.

For what it's worth, I live in the same neighbhourhood and kids on fat bikes have really become a huge nuisance. Been living in this area almost 8 years and never had it so bad like it's been the last few months. Speeding around on footpaths, not following basic traffic rules even when on the road and a few times I have also heard about intimidating behaviour (like yours). The police doesn't do much and IMO because there are no repercussions it just emboldens the kids.",,,
,I live by a high school where every child has a fat bike. They keep vandalizing our parked bikes and nothing being done. Police comes and goes.  They even bully the police. Once I witnessed police arrived to scene and they literally got the police into a circle and closed on them strategically. That s when I realized these are gangs who know what to do and what not to do. Most of them buy their bikes themselves god knows how they make such amount though.,,,
,I once saw an old guy stick his cane out to knock some kid off his fat bike after said kid spit gum out at a couple dining on a terrace right before. It was very satisfying.,,,
,"The craziest thing about living here is that when you tell other people that gangs of 10 year olds basically terrorize the city people laugh and think you‚Äôre making it up because it sounds so absurd.

I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you OP. Just know it‚Äôs not your fault. Shitty parents who don‚Äôt know how to sit down with their kids emotionally and properly discipline them end up with kids like this with no boundaries.",,,
,"I'm a Turkish guy who moved to Amsterdam about 10 years ago and have been living in Osdorp for the last 7 years. Our streets are full of these guys. I don't care about Dutch people's sensitivity to being labeled as racists; 90% of the time, these are Moroccan kids. Let's remove the elephant in the room, please.

Something similar happened to me years ago. They were hanging out in front of an apartment, and they spat at me when I was passing by. I have long light hair, and I think they thought I was Dutch or a naive European guy who doesn't react to this. If you compare Osdorp with where I grew up in Istanbul, it's like a playground in a park. So my reaction was to grab that bastard's neck, hit his back against the wall, and tell him I'd f\*ck his face in Turkish. It was just a reflex. One of them understood I'm Turkish and realized things would escalate, so they tried to calm me down and apologize on behalf of his friend. Those guys were around 15-16 and thought they were untouchable because no one reacts. They are just bullies without balls. They cannot do that kind of thing to people who look like Eastern Europeans, Russians, or dark-skinned people.

Of course, some people will tell me that I could be stabbed or worse. Believe me, guys, they don't have the balls to do that. Maybe I'm old or a boomer, but back in my time, if we acted like that, we couldn't go back home on our own two feet, and my father would punish me again after he learned I did such a thing. Their families simply don't care about what they are doing because they were raised like that, and their children will be the same because no one takes action.",,,

,"I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you.

I‚Äôm a runner and was running on the footpath, not bike path, last month in a non crowded area heading towards Sloterpark and had a kid on one of those bikes stick his leg out like he was trying to kick me while he went by. I stopped and then he slowed down like they he was waiting for me to run again so they could kick me a second time. When I got my phone out they sped off. 

I didn‚Äôt report because there was no contact and sadly also because when my husband had separate incidents the police did nothing and didn‚Äôt take a statement even.

Edit to add below:
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm adding this 2 days after I posted the above, but at an Industry event and career networking opportunity, myself and some others were walking outside and kids on bikes threw water and squirted us using water guns filled with ‚Äúiced sweet tea?‚Äù.

I was talking to a recruiter trying to ask questions about the company. Dressed in business casual attire including a white blouse. Completely shot in the face and all over my top. Got it in my eye too, and I was wearing eye makeup. Absolutely disgusting and not a great way to start our conversation. Had to go rinse off in the toilet when we got back to the building and try not to look like I‚Äôd cried my mascara and eyeliner off.",,,

,"Serious question about this, but what happens when you knock the kid off the bike or give them a good old smack. I take it you will have issues with the police and not the kid? This isn't specific to your incident OP, just a general question.

I feel like these kids have never experienced what it means to face consequences. The Netherlands is safe and cushy, and that is wonderful, but it can easily breed these types of miscreants since the lessons of cause and effect are never properly learned.",,,
,"This also happened to me: two kids, fat bike; Bos en Lommer.

,"4 girls aged about 16 spat on my wife riding down bilderdijkstraat on 2 fat bikes so i chased them down to tell them it‚Äôs not fucking cool and all hell broke loose. they followed us home all the way to westerpark and told us their brothers were coming to fuck me up. the whole debacle dragged on for an hour and ruined out friday night and we cancelled our dinner plans. they only finally pissed off after almost an hour of nonsense when my wife told them she was pregnant and they are causing her significant distress. now whenever i see youth groups on fatbikes, i will actively slow down or go a different way to avoid these morons. its a pity because when i was a teenager i would occasionally do stupid stuff but i had limits not to harass people and always respected strangers/ other adults. These fuckers do not give a fuck lol. this happened a few months ago but i felt compelled to share so you know OP you aren‚Äôt isolated nor is it your fault at all. I am sorry it happened. 

honestly if someone started a gofundme to destroy all the fatbikes i would gladly contribute.

I just kept on riding trying to understand if it was an accident until I saw them laughing menacingly. Now I know better, apparently you can claim self-defense if you do anything to physically hurt them in the moment in retaliation.

- don‚Äôt internalize this event. you did not do anything wrong, and this reflects entirely on the little prick

,"Btw, just to be clear, I don't see gentrification as a solution to problems... it also comes with its own sets of problems. I was just ranting about that particular area. I don't even live in Amsterdam but the name rings a bell for a reason.

I do think the Netherlands has a serious housing problem and wish it could be solved but since there has been a shortage since WWII times I don't think that is likely to be solved anytime soon.... not until all the baby boomers have kicked the bucket. But even then there is still a chance it won't be enough. But eventually (with less and less people affording to have children) maybe....",,,

I saw from my class window the vaping kids cycle, but didn't think any of it. My friend luckily wasn't hurt, since the kids we're weak and out of shape, but he did do ""aangifte"" to the police.

Kids these days can be so awful. Today, I went out for a bike ride, and just before I got home, I heard some kids yelling and then saw a car speeding past and stopping on the fietspad in front of them. The driver got out and started yelling at the kids. I didn‚Äôt see what happened, but he was definitely not happy. Apparently, they had thrown an egg at his car.

Just last week my bf and I were cycling to watch the football with friends when someone was frantically ringing to pass us. I don‚Äôt mean the ringing of someone in a rush, but continuous ringing without giving us any time to actually move. 

When we got round to making room it turned out to be two 12-14 year old boys on a fatbike. My bf called them out, just saying that maybe they should be a bit more patient. They immediately got verbally aggressive and said they would keep doing as they pleased (among many curse words). 

Once they passed we expressed our hope to each other that they‚Äôll put an age limit on fat bikes and prohibit this behaviour soon. They overheard and yelled at us they hope that ‚Äúyou fucking shit Dutch people will be prohibited soon (ik hoop dat ze alle fucking kk Nederlanders binnenkort verbieden)‚Äù. Like what???

,"A bunch of ass hats on scooters harassing people just outside the McDonalds in the city centre. Shouting at folks walking by, honking their horns to startle people. An old lady politely asked them to stop, they just laughed in her face, gave her the finger and beeped their scooters at her so they ""couldn't hear"" her. That's when I decided to step in.

I asked them to stop, a bit less politely. They did the same to me so I returned their gesture, turned around to walk away. I heard an engine start and rev hard, so I turned to see one riding straight towards me. I knew there was a woman and her child just behind me, so didn't jump out the way as I didn't want to risk their safety.


The scooter crashed straight into me, but I dragged the guy off the vehicle and threw him to the ground and told him to stay down. He got up, I threw him around a bit, just tripping him over and over again telling him to stay down. Didn't throw any punches cos he was half my size and just a dumb kid. His friends tried to intervene, I dodged a few punches and shoved them back. I'm easily twice their size and the last time I hit someone I was very worried they weren't going to wake up. So just acted defensively until bystanders got between us and some old ladies calmed me down.

I was apologising to old ladies and trying to de-escalate the situation in general. But someone annoying hurled some racist remarks at the kids which riled them up again. But they were keeping their distance from me so I decided to just walk away again until the police arrived. Just as I did, the same kid on the scooter ran up from behind and sucker punched me and ran away hiding behind his friends and the old ladies who were telling me it's not worth it.

I wanted to make sure the shitheads stuck around so the police could identify them but the old ladies told me to just walk away, assured me the police could ID the license plates of the scooters and catch them anyway. So I followed her advice and returned to the restaurant I was eating at to clean myself up.

When the police showed up, I turned myself in and admitted to my part in instigating the confrontation. The old ladies stuck around to share their story and support my side but the police were pathetically useless. They offered me first aid, but they had nothing stocked in their police car and ended up asking me to go into the McDonalds and ask them instead. I asked if they'd pursue the hooligans, their comments included some very distasteful stereotypes about the kids involved, and told me I'd have to file a police report in order for them to do any police work. Me and my partner were frankly so shocked and appalled by how little they gave a fuck so decided to just leave cos the police were infuriatingly unwilling to help in any way.",,,
,"1) So called assault? This was a term used by the police involved and the definition used by the individual that filed my police report. I went to report an incident, they classified it as an assault. Just cos I could have done better, I don't appreciate your analysis when I got hit by a scooter so a mother and child didn't have to. Driving a vehicle at someone is just so called assault according to you.

2) Your selective reading missed the part about: not being equipped to provide first aid, relying on a McDonald's instead. They couldn't deal with the situation in any way immediately, I had to make an appointment to file a report 3 days later. The only reason they had anything to ""investigate"" was because I had to force them to do some police work through a police report. Otherwise, a melee in broad daylight occured with zero repurcussions. Is that what is required for the police to enforce the law and keep the peace? You drive a scooter into someone, in one of the most surveiled area of the city, and it takes them over half a year to identify a suspect? 20 of the witnesses could tell you their license plate on the spot. They fled the scene like a bunch of criminals whereas I stayed around to accept responsibility for my part in the situation.

,"I filed a police report the earliest I could which was half a week later (it occurred on a Sunday). The lady who took my statements and filed the reports had also made comments stereotyping the group which was quite unpleasant to hear. She did however say that although I could have dealt with the situation better, she would have probably done the same thing.

I forgot to mention that the guys were constantly saying that they'd come back and shoot everyone.

I heard back maybe 8 months later telling me that they had identified a suspect and I could be contacted to go to court. 5-6 months after that, another message telling me that there was insufficient evidence to pursue the case. I remember vividly being surprised even hearing back at all considering it was over a year since the incident.

Was incredibly angry with the situation and for a while there, I was wondering if I should have shown less restraint so that I wouldn't have been sucker punched.

Crazily enough, maybe 5 months later some drunk on a scooter hit a pedestrian on the sidewalk just a couple meters behind me. He jumped off his scooter and immediately tried to start a fight with the person he collided with. I initially tried to just break it up and stand between them but the drunk tried to slap my glasses off my face. I lost my temper and elbowed him in the face, breaking his nose. He then tried to punch me in the balls so I kicked him in the face, he started snoring so hard I thought I might have killed him.

I put him in the recovery position, threw away his scooter keys and just went into a nearby store to do the grocery shopping I had left the house to do. The guy comes into the store, asking me to fight him outside whilst blood was pouring from his face and he was still badly concussed. The storekeepers (who I was tight with cos it's the neighbourhood corner shop) thankfully held the guy back cos he was insisting on fighting me and wouldn't let me go home.

When I got home, I called the police, expecting them to already have received some calls about the situation. I was surprised to hear nobody had called it in (this occurred in a popular and busy shopping street in the Hague, just down the road less than 1km from the police station). I basically turned myself in but was insisting that they should look for the guy on the scooter as he was drunk and now concussed, driving a vehicle around town.

,"I give you two opposing thoughts and you choose what is more likely to reduce the number of addicts (income source for drug gangs).

* Harshly criminalise drug usage, ownership and so on. Resulting in addicts being left alone, developing paranoia and most likely being pushed to the border of society. Resulting in crime to finance their addiction.
* Decriminalise drug usage, build help programs for addicts that mitigate bad habits (needle recycling) and at best therapy for quitting and managing the withdrawal. Basically treat addiction as a sickness instead of a crime. Also school in drug usage, dosages and contermination risks to minimise further health impact on them and their social environment.

The reasons for drug usage are huge, but in many cases it's an attempt to self meditation for untreated health problems (both psychological and physical). So the next step would be to offer better mental health help, before it even descends into addiction.",,,

If your opinion is based on your subjective argument, anecdote, personal experience, etc then it's not a fact. I'm just trying to say this is not the only cause.

When I was a kid in Istanbul around the '90s and annoyed people on the bus, in the park, or in any public environment, people used to warn us a few times, and if we kept it up, they would kick us out using force. If I told that to my father, he would punish me for behaving like that too. I'm not saying using violence is the right way‚Äîtimes have changed, and the reaction could be verbal, escalating to authorities etc ‚Äîbut it's always better than no reaction.

This is not related to being beaten or imprisoned or to police states. The police had nothing to do with that. You're coming up with a hasty generalization fallacy here.

Yes, I'm lucky, and I'm aware that I should raise a kid who can live in peace with society in this country. If I would think my values are not corresponds with the society I wouldn't moved to the Netherlands and this is exactly why I moved out of Turkey.

,"When you have these experiences yourself, and your friends have them too, and their friends, colleagues, and there are loads of similar stories online everywhere, anecdotes become statistics... The ""system"" here is an utter failure. People get late cancer diagnosis, many die totally preventable deaths.

In Romania, I can see any specialist I want in a matter of days, with no referral if I'm ok to pay for the consult in a private clinic. They do lots of needed tests on the spot, instead of trying to convince you they are not needed, and then having to wait weeks, sometimes months for an ultrasound and interpretation.

It's beyond fixable at this point here, the only solution is to stop regulating every price and liberalize the market, so that more private clinics can emerge.",,,

Regardless. OP go do a walk by appointment at a GP. Quickest and easiest is to make an appointment at Amsterdam Central Station GP practice. It's called 'central doctors'. It's the quickest and easiest way which in this case, you want. They are specialized in std stuff, vaxx and tourists so they do a lot of one time appointments. 

You can go calling a shit ton of GPs if they have time for a 'passerby' appointment, but don't make it hard on yourself bc you want this taken care of asap.
'Passerby appointments' at the gp are about 25-30 euros afaik. The syphilis test is about 30 euros (rip just having to Google that lol). But one person having a proven std makes it more likely there may be more. You should ask for at least the most common panel included with the syph screening (chlamydia and gonnorhea), the rarer ones like HIV and hep B might be good too if your sexual partner was high risk in any way. There's criteria for that, the gp will be able to help you differentiate but some obvious ones are sex workers, men having sex with men, partner being from SE Asia, certain eastern European countries and parts of Africa, IV drug users. Since you had no luck with GGD these criteria are probably not your sexual partner, but something to keep in mind. 

Then when you have this all sorted out you can get a fixed GP. Hope you're negative, wish you the best!",,,

Weekly Q&A - All Questions Go Here (Especially Tourists and New Residents),"
This is the place for anyone to ask questions about Amsterdam. If you are a tourist visiting Amsterdam, you are moving to or recently arrived in Amsterdam, or you just have a basic question about life in Amsterdam and want some advice, this is the place to post your question. This post is refreshed every week on Sunday. Please feel free to repost in subsequent weeks.

**READ THE WIKI FIRST.** The people answering questions are locals who want to share the city they love with visitors, but only with people who make an effort. Read at least the Essential Tourist Information in our [world-famous wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/wiki/index) before you ask a question. Otherwise, you may be told to go back and read it. The wiki is written by us, and updated when relevant. If the entries are old it's because nothing has changed.

**HOTELS ARE EXPENSIVE AND WE DON'T HAVE GOOD ADVICE ON THEM.** Because we live here, we don't know what the best hotels are. Amsterdam is one of the most touristed cities in the world and has the [highest hotel prices](https://www.cheaprooms.co.uk/press/spring18.html) in Europe. The city is deliberately [trying to reduce tourism by raising the prices](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/amsterdam-bans-new-hotels-fight-against-mass-tourism-2024-04-17/). There really isn't a secret ""cheap"" solution. Most ""Airport"" hotels are not connected to the Airport and will be more trouble getting to than it's worth.

**TOURISTS CAN PURCHASE MARIJUANA, DESPITE WHAT YOU READ IN FOREIGN PRESS.** Understand that the coffeeshops are just a tiny part of Amsterdam, so posts that treat Amsterdam like it's the Las Vegas of drugs sometimes get a negative response. We're happy to give you advice about coffeeshops and to discuss drug policy. The experts are our friends at /r/AmsterdamEnts, ask them the big questions.

**WE DON'T HELP WITH ILLEGAL STUFF AND WILL BAN YOU FOR ASKING.** We will not help you with things that are clearly illegal. Coffeeshops caught selling to minors get shut down and everyone loses their jobs. Authorities check for people smuggling marijuana out of the country. Hard drugs are illegal and so is asking for or selling them on Reddit.

**WE DON'T ALLOW TICKET SALES OR TRADING.** We do not allow selling, buying, or trading tickets on /r/Amsterdam due to the high rate of fraud. You should do everything on ticketswap.nl. We're aware that is difficult to get tickets to Anne Frank, van Gogh, etc. We have no solutions for you, sorry.

**WE PROBABLY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE RED LIGHT DISTRICT** but you can get some good tips from [this thread from a sex worker](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/193zi9j/i_am_a_sex_worker_in_the_red_light_district_if/).  

**DOE AARDIG.** There is Dutch directness and there is rudeness. The people coming here don't know how we do things, and are usually well-meaning people who just want to enjoy the city we love. Be kind to them. For the tourists and new residents, please remember that we are not Google; respect our time by doing some basic research first and then asking your questions like you're speaking to a real human who is volunteering to speak to you.

I (F) moved to Amsterdam last month and have chatted with guys on dating apps. Many I‚Äôve had conversations with for a week and they barely suggest actually meeting.

They might say something like, ‚ÄúIt would be great to meet in person‚Äù and when I say that I‚Äôd love to, they just carry on the conversation and are not in a hurry to suggest a day. This has really stumped me because everywhere else I‚Äôve dated we usually chat for 1-3 days max (and not super long convos generally) and then he suggests a date and a plan is made.

Recently, I received a job offer from a well-known company in Amsterdam. The offer seems quite good (75k including the 8% holiday allowance), and I would likely be eligible for the 30% ruling. My main challenge is that I would need to relocate to Amsterdam or a nearby city because the job is hybrid. Although I have EU citizenship, I currently live in South America. I am aware that the housing crisis has made renting a nightmare in the Netherlands, especially in Amsterdam.

Unfortunately, the company does not offer a relocation package. The starting date is very soon (mid-August), and I am already trying to assess my options for renting, possibly by hiring a company to help me out (like Relocify).

However, it has been a week since I accepted the offer, and the company has not yet sent me the contract. I have expressed my concerns about housing and relocation to them, but I have not received a response. As I am currently in the dark, I would like to seek some advice: Is this normal? Should I expect to have the employment contract before relocating and giving notice to my current employer? From my research, it seems that you need to have a signed contract for your rental application to be considered. Although the job offer specifies my gross salary and the contract length (twelve months), it does not contain any signatures.

If anyone could offer insight into my current situation, I would be very grateful.

,"I don‚Äôt support what has been done here (pictured), and I understand the points being made in your comment section, but:

A) it‚Äôs been l eight months and the slaughter continues, yet very few (if any) major Western nations have bothered to even lift a finger to help the Palestinian people, or even pay lip service to their struggle and denounce the actions of Netanyahu‚Äôs government/war cabinet and the IDF.

B) Admittedly I live in the UK, and not the Netherlands. The Palestinian Solidarity Campaign organises marches and other events here EVERY SATURDAY, with the most widely attended ones being in London, with marches of up to 500,000 people attending.

Even in an election year, there has been no movement from the top echelons of British politics to condemn the actions of Netanyahu and his war cabinet or those of the IDF. Britain has, alongside the US, consistently vetoed calls in the UN to demand a ceasefire, or abstained from voting. The politician looking most likely to win the election is a former human rights lawyer and was head of the Crown Prosecution Service; in the early days of the war, he said that the State of Israel had the right to cut off power and water to Palestine (which it controls). Aside from being morally and ethically abhorrent, THIS IS A WAR CRIME.

One of the lessons that history teaches us, is that if the people feel that they are not being listened to, they will become violent, as violence demands attention. I believe that violence lessens the legitimacy of any argument that a person or group makes, but my beliefs do not change human nature.",,,
,"My rage is not performative. I live in extreme anger constantly. These people are being bombed, murdered, tortured and violated in the worst ways possible. The IDF is the most vile organization I have ever had to be exposed to, and I have the immense privilege of only seeing them through screens. I‚Äôm haunted by what I see though. Pictures of men parading through streets with the women‚Äôs lingerie that they murdered and burned to death, trapped under rubble and shot down. Not to mention the women they get to alive. IDF soliders posing with peace signs and their tongue sticking out with a blind folded, hand-cuffed person behind them last year before October 7th. 

There‚Äôs so many horrors. I think about them constantly. The video of the grandfather sobbing as he holds his decapitated baby granddaughter. The pictures of the little girl who was hanging from a metal rod half naked after her house was bombed. The stories of the people who survived tent and white phosphorus burning.

If you‚Äôre not screaming in anger‚Ä¶ then what are you doing? I agree, that these actions by most students don‚Äôt really lead anywhere, but I doubt most of their rage is performative. It‚Äôs genuine, they just don‚Äôt fucking know better. And what are we supposed to do, really? These people are cooking grass for their families. Did you see the video of the mother breaking down and sobbing because all she could find for her children to watch were herbs? I can‚Äôt unhear her. Her sobs echo in my heart. These people have NOTHING. And they‚Äôre being massacred, worse than massacared, really. 

You call these students righteous revolutionaries. They‚Äôre the only ones who seem appropriately upset to me though? Where is your anger, your action? What  have you done so far? I haven‚Äôt been to a student protest in ages (i‚Äôm disabled so they are now too dangerous for me sadly), but I was there in the beginning. We are part of the reason why this genocide has gotten so much attention. We have shown the world, that we care and will not be silent. THAT is the main purpose of the protests. Not to enact groundbreaking change. Not to bring world peace. But to FORCE people to look. The school will recover when all this is done. They buildings will be cleaned and refurbished and it will be as if nothing ever happened. They‚Äôll get a few thousand from the next thousands of students that enroll (if the housing market here doesn‚Äôt collapse first) and it will be as if nothing ever happened.

,"GENEVA (19 February 2024) ‚Äì UN experts* today expressed alarm over credible allegations of egregious human rights violations to which Palestinian women and girls continue to be subjected in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
Palestinian women and girls have reportedly been arbitrarily executed in Gaza, often together with family members, including their children, according to information received. ‚ÄúWe are shocked by reports of the deliberate targeting and extrajudicial killing of Palestinian women and children in places where they sought refuge, or while fleeing. Some of them were reportedly holding white pieces of cloth when they were killed by the Israeli army or affiliated forces,‚Äù the experts said.

The experts expressed serious concern about the arbitrary detention of hundreds of Palestinian women and girls, including human rights defenders, journalists and humanitarian workers, in Gaza and the West Bank since 7 October. Many have reportedly been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment, denied menstruation pads, food and medicine, and severely beaten. On at least one occasion, Palestinian women detained in Gaza were allegedly kept in a cage in the rain and cold, without food.

‚ÄúWe are particularly distressed by reports that Palestinian women and girls in detention have also been subjected to multiple forms of sexual assault, such as being stripped naked and searched by male Israeli army officers. At least two female Palestinian detainees were reportedly raped while others were reportedly threatened with rape and sexual violence,‚Äù the experts said. They also noted that photos of female detainees in degrading circumstances were also reportedly taken by the Israeli army and uploaded online.

The experts expressed concern that an unknown number of Palestinian women and children, including girls, have reportedly gone missing after contact with the Israeli army in Gaza. ‚ÄúThere are disturbing reports of at least one female infant forcibly transferred by the Israeli army into Israel, and of children being separated from their parents, whose whereabouts remain unknown,‚Äù they said.

‚ÄúWe remind the Government of Israel of its obligation to uphold the right to life, safety, health, and dignity of Palestinian women and girls and to ensure that no one is subjected to violence, torture, ill-treatment or degrading treatment, including sexual violence,‚Äù the experts said.

They called for an independent, impartial, prompt, thorough and effective investigation into the allegations and for Israel to cooperate with such investigations.

‚ÄúTaken together, these alleged acts may constitute grave violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, and amount to serious crimes under international criminal law that could be prosecuted under the Rome Statute,‚Äù the experts said. ‚ÄúThose responsible for these apparent crimes must be held accountable and victims and their families are entitled to full redress and justice,‚Äù they added.

They have on multiple occasions bombed the locations where Aid was dropped afterwards (since they‚Äòre making it impossible for aid trucks to enter, again showing how their goal is maximum civilian casualities).

You love to say that there is zero tolerance regarding nazism and fascism, but somehow when it comes to other forms of oppressions that are like the Shoah, i.e. the genocide in Palestine, or in Congo, you need protestors and activists to be friendly with you so that you can listen to their plight? Where is that automatism and logic now?

One thing MLK, Mandela, Sankara and many Pan Africans were right about is that people like you are just pseudo democracy supporters: you need to control the way people protest for you to care about the values you claim you cherish, but in reality you have little interest in those values with your exceptions, e.g. here ""but they're making graffitis and stuff how can I be against genocide now"".

And don't come with ""but I'm not pro genocide"" because this discussion should not even happen. Either you're pro or you're against. Just like in Germany and the NL etc people love to say we shouldn't have any debate or discussion with Nazis, or fascists (I agree).

If your values depend on how others protests then your values are weak. Being anti genocide and pro democracy means you don't put an asterisk next to it. If you want a better world then you lift everyone up, it's not by making exceptions based on the people that thing about caring or not.

we also all know that all the land does belong to israel.   
just because romans destroyed it to a extend, and then ottomans destroyed it all and purged the jews more or less from there doesnt mean history starts when u wanted it to start.   
if u want palenstina to have their ""land"" then u should also chant for turkey to fuck off and give it back to greece and armenia. cus turks in reality dont exist in that place. 

see what i did there? just because u think something doesnt mean we all have to agree. i dont think any1 approves what israel is doing bombing the living shit out of towns but hey.  Do we approve what hamas did? did people stand up against that? no just israel did hamas started a war and after 1 day they where hiding in their basements leaving the war to the people. Now the people in gaza where kicking and spitting on corpses and chanting for hamas on the first day of attack didnt they? so why should i feel sorry when a palenstinian is getting shot? (yes i feel bad for both sides but u dont seem to get it).

Then the Arabs rejected partition plans and all surrounding Arab countries invaded Palestine, not to free Palestinians but to kill Jews.

,"Yes, colonial settlers were on the wrong side of history. So were the slave traders, the crusaders, the Vikings, the Ashanti etc..

But time moves on. After a number of generations, newborns can  no longer be held accountable for what their ancestors may have established. I used the US and its history as an example. Europeans were bad for sure. But now there are 333 million Americans. Native Americans born today, have the exact same rights as any other American citizen. Perhaps even more, because within the designated reserves they can be exempt from certain laws that would be applicable elsewhere. This is why you see enormous casinos thrive there. But there are negative sides to their independence. Their education systems and work ethics are less likely to deliver economically viable citizens. Native Americans are by far the poorest demographic in the USA. Multiple studies have been conducted on this topic ([example](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2020/redbird-what-drives-native-american-poverty.html)).

So yes it's bad what happened centuries ago. But that was then. It would be quite ridiculous for a radical Native American movement to stand up and rise up against America and demand the 333 million citizens to leave their land. It's simply too late. That fight was lost long ago. And none of the descendants can influence what happened in the 18th century. 

So they can, and should seek justice within reason. They can make themselves heard through non-violent channels. But there is no going back to the old times before the European settlers arrived. After multiple generations, they have acquired their own rights by merely having had no influence on what happened in the past.

Also - there is no way the Palestinians will cease to exist. Even during the so-called genocide since Oct 7th, more babies were born on Gaza than people were killed. It's a cruel way to look at it, but even in this misery the Gaza people managed to increase their population by a decent margin.",,,

Militants posed with bodies in the streets of Gaza and in videos and photos, violating the personal dignity of the dead persons‚Äù

‚ÄúIn one case, a nine-month-old baby girl, was shot and killed while hiding with her mother in their safe room in Be‚Äôeri.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Commission found evidence of mistreatment of civilians and ISF members in several locations, and significant evidence on the desecration of corpses, including sexualized desecration, decapitations, lacerations, burning, severing of body parts and undressing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Commission found that seven female soldiers were taken to Gaza as hostages and viewed footage showing that they had been subjected to physical and verbal abuse. Four female bodies found at Nahal Oz outpost were partially or completely undressed, two of which were isolated in separate rooms, showing signs of physical abuse and sexual violence.‚Äù

‚ÄúHamas military wing rejected all accusations that its forces committed sexual violence against Israeli women. However, the Commission documented cases indicative of sexual violence perpetrated against women and men in and around the Nova festival site, as well as the Nahal Oz military outpost and several kibbutzim, including Kfar Aza, Re‚Äôim and Nir Oz. It collected and preserved digital evidence, including images of victims‚Äô bodies displaying indications of sexual violence, a pattern corroborated by independent testimonies from witnesses. Reliable witness accounts obtained by the Commission describe bodies that had been undressed, in some incidents with exposed genitals. The Commission received reports and verified digital evidence concerning the restraining of women, including hands and sometimes feet of women being bound, often behind the victims‚Äô backs, prior to their abduction or killing. Additionally, the Commission made assessments based on the position of the body, for example images displaying legs spread or bent over, and signs of struggle or violence on the body, such as stab wounds, burns, lacerations and abrasions.‚Äù

And re. support, that's because the world would rather a democracy with equal rights irrespective of age, religion, sex, or ethnicity as per their Declaration of Independence and Knesset (yes, the apartheid is a fallacy) than an Islamist extremist theocracy - the Hamas option.

It doesn't matter that Israel might have known. That's like saying ""well, you saw me pouring petrol all around my house, you should have stopped me before I burnt it to the ground""

And, you are the person who claimed there were no hostages apart from Palestinian, was just correcting you.

I don't believe Palestinians don't get to retaliate, but Israel does too under that logic. And we're in this mess because both sides keep fricking retaliating. I've got empathy for everyone, but Hamas' attack provoked an entirely predictable response. They also keep putting fighters in refuge camps and hospitals. You know what isn't allowed, under the Geneva convention? That. Because it makes them targets, and then more people die.

I'd have more sympathy for their cause if the attack had been on a legitimate target (i.e, military installation, not civilian festival)

Hezbollah was created as a resistance to Israel and their main objective is to free palestine. If palestine is content and has a nation then Hezbollah will have no more legitimacy to fight the israelis. The ball has always been in the court of Israel.

How can you expect them to move on? You are not making any sense honestly. Its not like the oppression has stopped and palestinians are just asking for more. They are asking for the bare minimum civil rights! Im sorry but you cannot defend israel. There is no excuse for the brutality and terrorism they are inflicting on these poor people.

The trouble is Gaza is a different story and sadly, they set a problematic example. Isra√´l won't be keen to grant West Bank similar treatment as they did with Gaza in 2005. So yes - I would say the Zionist settlers should leave occupied territory on the West Bank. But having seen what happened when they did the same in Gaza is not exactly inspirational.

I think a 2 state solution is the only way forward but don't believe we should leave it to Isra√´l to drive this. It would mean building 2 huge walls around Isra√´l, with a neutral zone in between, enforced by international peacekeepers. West Bank and Gaza would need to find other friends to help build their infrastructure, supply of water and electricity etc. And still, they should refrain from firing rockets into Isra√´l on a daily basis.",,,

I support Israel because, despite everything, it IS a democracy which protects ALL its citizens. It upholds  the rights to demonstrate (free speech), gender equality, queerness, religion and ethnic differences IN FACT. 
Is it ideal? No! It has been attacked into war by Arab supremacist regimes repeatedly, and still it has managed to create a 1st World country in leas than a century. The same time the Palestinian side has had, but kept bemoaning because they loss all their armed conflicts (which they initiated). 
There ARE many social issues, mostly stemming from fear and constant external interference. The Palestinians are to be pitied, buy the ultimate enemy is not Israel.

Hamas specifically rewrote their statement in 2017 to address the perceived ‚Äúantisemitism‚Äù

>16. Hamas affirms that its conflict is with the Zionist project not with the Jews because of their religion. Hamas does not wage a struggle against the Jews because they are Jewish but wages a struggle against the Zionists who occupy Palestine. Yet, it is the Zionists who constantly identify Judaism and the Jews with their own colonial project and illegal entity.

""The Commission documented many incidents in which ISF systematically targeted and subjected Palestinians to SGBV online and in person since October 7, including through forced public nudity, forced public stripping, sexualized torture and abuse, and sexual humiliation and harassment. These incidents took place during ground operations in conjunction with evacuations and arrests. Based on testimonies and verified video footage and photographs, the Commission finds that sexual violence has been perpetrated throughout the OPT during evacuation processes, prior to or during arrest, at civilian homes and at a shelter for women and girls. Sexual acts were carried out by force, including under threats, intimidation and other forms of duress, in inherently coercive circumstances due to the armed conflict and the presence of armed Israeli soldiers.""

You cannot negotiate with your hostage taker, they have the power. Which is why the burden lies with Israel to show they are willing to act in good faith.",,,
,"Israel does not want a permanent ceasefire. Palestine is occupied and Israel is not willing to negotiate in good faith. They put forward bogus proposals that are nowhere near what Hamas would accept as reasonable, knowing full well it will be rejected, so they can turn around and say ""see Hamas doesn't want peace, we need to bomb them."" Hamas has been exceedingly clear in their demands but Israel will not negotiate because they want the genocide to continue. That's what I meant. Israel has rejected any ceasefire that meets both sides demands because they are not interested in peace. Netanyahu is a genocidal maniac only interested in expanding Israel's borders.",,,
,"I am not necessarily saying I support Isra√´l. I can see it is a country that's internally torn. But also a country which has to fight for its mere existence. No other place in the whole region is as prosperous, has comparable scientific and economic output and allows people to thrive regardless of their gender preferences. It is actually a democracy, which is not a given in the entire middle east.

I know all the stories about Gaza being an open air prison. And I understand it must be horrible to live there. But you cannot expect Isra√´l to just open things up without any change in Gaza leadership. Because as long as Hamas is in charge, and widely supported, opening up Gaza is a suicidal move. The people in Gaza would have been a lot better if they had opposed the radical direction of Hamas. If they had shown they used concrete and steel to build schools instead of madrassas, tunnels and rockets.

Even the son of one of the Hamas leaders agrees on this. He fled Gaza and his story is remarkable. I invite you to listen to his perspective on Gaza, the Palestinians and Hamas. His name is Mosab Hassan Youssef.",,,
,"Right - you cite sources that claim Hamas is not antisemitic by nature. They simply do not accept the existence of Isra√´l as a legitimate nation. Even though the last 10.000 Zionist settlers left Gaza against their will in 2005, under pressure from the Israeli government, Hamas kept firing rockets into Isra√´l and we all know how their heroic martyrs behaved on October 7th. If you truly believe raping Jewish women like they did is an act of self defense and a legitimate part of their struggle against the oppressor, I think there is little point in continuing the conversation.

Look at the number of Jews or Christians that can peacefully live in Islamic nations. 400.000 Jews used to live in North Africa. Ever since Isra√´l was founded, they have been targeted and their numbers declined significantly ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghrebi_Jews). Sure, the creation of Isra√´l as a state can be debated. But at which point can we agree and accept its existence. Arabs tried and failed miserably to defeat Isra√´l and that happened a few generations ago. At some point, it's a done deal. Be smart and live with the new reality. This is how the world map has come to be. Hardly any country has managed to remain unchanged, unconquered throughout its history. And Palestine was not even an autonomous nation when Isra√´l was founded. We can agree this was perhaps not the best geopolitical move in the history of mankind. Look at the map of Europe. Borders have changed, new countries were born, some countries were split up. Shit happens.

I think it is time for the Arab world to just count their losses and focus on their own pursuit of prosperity, rather than turning the eternal battle against the Zionists into their only reason for existence. We also seem to forget that a lot of Arabs coexist with Jews within Isra√´l. They are even represented in the Knesset.. I wonder how many Jews are represented in government roles in the Arab nations.

Sure, the Palestines can choose to continue their useless battle. But it won't do them, nor their offspring any favours. It will just continue the bloodshed.

I believe in a 2 state solution but it will have to be orchestrated by the international community. Perhaps an international peacekeeping force can be positioned between Isra√´l and the surrounding Palestinian territories. 

But it also means the Palestinians will need to find new friends and sources for all their infrastructure. Because without Isra√´l, they would not have water, electricity, internet etc. And I pity the  people in Palestine. Gaza has become more and more Islamic and even before Oct 7th, Gaza women no longer had the freedom they used to have 20 years ago.

My impression is that they are a bit shy and won‚Äôt approach you in the street or public spaces in general and I am also way too shy to make the first move. I try to make eye contact and smile a lot when I‚Äôm in public. 

Side note: how does that even work?? Going to a bar alone to find a man???

Anyway, where can I meet a gezellig Dutch future-husband?

Thanks in advance! ",0,30,Full_Ratio3871

,"As a dutch guy who grew up mostly abroad and am now working and living here for 10 years I can say that most dutch people form their social circles are a young age and they stick to those. Within these circles they often find their dating partners often had a young age and thus they are already dating for years by the time they are 25. As an outsider (I became an outsider cause I was raised abroad and lost all my childhood friends in the proces) it is not easy to get in those circles. Even if the guys are not shy they are often satisfied with their social circle and therefore won't feel the need to approach new people. I also don't think the husband material type of guys are the ones you come across at bars or dating apps. Since you are essentially at a disadvantage therefore my first advice would be to find a way to overcome your shyness that is preventing you from making the first move as you will need to overcome this obstacle to stand a better chance. In todays dating world you are going to need to do some of the heavy lifting and simply only eye contact and smiling are not going to work. You will need to start making the first move if you want to greatly increase your chances of dating a dutch guy.

Furthermore there are also some social meetup gatherings which even though have a large expat attendance, dutch guys also attend those events. These are the dutch guys that in their professional and private life interact a lot with non-dutch people and therefore are far more open dating a non-dutch girl. Maybe join one of those events.",,,

- go to board games clubs
- go to meetups (expats, karaoke, pub quizzes, comedy)
- go to bars you like (a specific vibe, or type of music?)
- go to nightclubs that play the music you like
- go to craft afternoons (better for meeting women honestly)
- go to laser tag
- go to special interest movie nights
- tell yourself that you'll talk to three people at an event, then if you're still not enjoying yourself, you can go home

I also go to kink and queer events, but it's very possible that that's not your scene. 

Also it might be something about the way you present yourself that makes you less popular to Dutch men specifically, I don't know. They don't tend to go for women who have dressed up to the nines and have a full face of makeup. Like lipstick, concealer, and mascara is probably plenty. 

Or you might be giving off ""desperation"" energy. You like yourself, right? You're not putting anything off ""until you find a boyfriend"", right? You have female and male friendships, right? It's a lot easier to find a partner if you are comfortable in your own skin. 

Also you need to be prepared for the average Dutch man to tell you *exactly* what he thinks, and it could be rude or feel insulting.

Cycling in Vondelpark (Part 2),"A few weeks back I posted about a 100km ride in Vondelpark asking whether there were examples of people completing long-distance cycles within Vondelpark, I did not get a clear answer.

So, I decided to set the (Un)Official World Record for Longest Ride completed in Vondelpark at 200km!

This was completed overnight, whilst wearing a helmet and multiple lights to ensure safety!

Some highlights from the ride;

* I put out 3 bin fires
* Last runner was seen at 1:41am
* First runner was seen at 5:09am
* I completed 55+ Laps of Vondelpark and I saw at least 1 cyclist on every lap!

Here is a link to the ride on Strava:¬†[https://strava.app.link/qMWPsJZPBKb](https://strava.app.link/qMWPsJZPBKb)¬†(Kudos' are appreciated)

No show fee from dentist,"Hi everyone,

I got Covid last week and couldn't go to the dentist. I called them a day before my appointment to inform them that I had Covid and was feeling terrible, so I couldn't come. They told me they would have to charge me for not giving 48 hours' notice. I explained that I had no other choice but to stay at home. Yesterday, they sent me an invoice for the no-show fee. I don't want to pay this fee and don't want to go to this dentist anymore. Can they forward this to debt collection and initiate a legal dispute? Can I object and win this case? What do you think?

Many thanks in advance. ",26,45,Representative_Owl_2

,"I‚Äôm a dentist and never instituted no show fees.

If you signed something in your intro packet that says you will be charged for a cancellation less than 48hrs, they can collect. I‚Äôd threaten them with a non payment and a negative google review.

Admittedly, they are perhaps a little too lenient, but the point is they can decide this for themselves.

>not very careful with hygiene

One does not exclude the other. Don't know about your dentist, but well before COVID you'd have to sanitise your hands before getting in and seats were always wiped down and cleaned with instruments being replaced between patients. (But I'm aware that in OP's case it might be different).",,,

,"Because people can't make the difference between their opinion and the facts, they disagree with the guideline so downvote.",,,
,Ofcourse.  It‚Äôs not a law.  I think most dentist would if you do it 24hr before.  But this one doesn‚Äôt,,,

A sincere apologies and thank you!,"Bit of a long shot maybe! Whilst visiting a gift shop on the 7th of June on the Raadhuisstraat, I fell into an open hatch 2m down into the basement of the shop whilst putting an item back on the wall (No substances involved haha).

In the instant aftermath of the fall, someone was there to help me out whilst I was in a lot of pain and covered by items from the wall that came along on the journey down. Looking back, due to the adrenaline and shock, I felt like I was quite rude to this person. 

I never managed to thank them and apologise as they went on their way before I left for the hospital. As I said, bit of a long shot but if by any chance someone you know had a great story in the pub of seeing someone fall down 2m into a basement of a gift shop on a Friday night (I hope it's not a daily occurrence) then please let them know I am thankful and sorry and hopefully I can send them a thank you card.

Taalcafe to practice your dutch in a safe space every Monday at 19h,"Hi everyone!

If you are also trying to improve and practice your dutch (but are too intimidated to talk with dutch natives yet), DM and I'll send you the info :)

Anyone got an old SD card they aren't using? ,"Hi all! 

I recently bought an old digital camera (2000s) to take photos on and have bought 2 SD cards for it so far and neither work! One is 64GB and the other is 8GB. Each time I get an SD error message. However, when I use my roommate's ancient SD card, which is only 1GB it works perfectly! 

I was wondering if anyone had a very old, low GB SD card kicking around or new where to get one?

Help me move someone to Overhoeks.,"Hi!

My girlfriend really doesn't want to move to Overhoeks. She thinks she'll miss the city life and her friends and is scared she'll be in trouble if she ever needs a car even though it's a 5 min walk to the ferry or city center by car. My house now has very thin walls and she doesn't feel safe outside. So I only want to move to a newly build area. My only other options prob will be Amstelkwartier and the Houthavens but these have longer waiting lists. Wwyd? Wait for something better or convince her?

Mijn vriendin wil echt niet naar Overhoeks verhuizen. Ze doet ofals ze uit de stad gaat wonen en is bang dat haar vriendinnen niet meer langskomen en het gedoe wordt als ze de auto nodig heeft. Ik wil echt nieuwbouw en ben klaar met de oude woning: te gehorig, en ze voelt zich niet veilig s'avonds. Misschien dat ik naar het Amstelkwartier of de Houthavens kan verhuizen, maar ik ga >1 jaar moeten wachten, en misschien is het dan buiten mijn budget. Wat lijkt verstandig: toch wachten of haar overtuigen?",0,18,Westernartlighht
,"Overhoeks is peak yuppy Amsterdam, I‚Äôve lived in all neighborhoods in Amsterdam and nowhere is as good as Overhoeks.

Several BN‚Äôers live there, natuurwijn around the corner, and the parking fees match the inner city. Nothing more that makes you feel like you live in the city, except that you dont need to live in a rundown house in the city center. The facilities are so much better than what any canal building can offer. Once you go nieuwbouw, there is no return.

,"I'd honestly recommend going a bit further to be close to the metro rather than the ferry. Ferry is okay but living here for 2 years I'm getting kinda tired of it. I'll regularly miss my train because there's big ships passing by, or because the captain is just super slow that day. Then on weekends it gets completely overwhelmed by tourists who are rude as fuck. A few times the ferry was so full we just had to wait for the next one lol. If you want to get a car there's no street parking so you have to pay 200 euros a month for a garage spot, but it's not rent controlled so next year they could make it 300 or whatever they want. There's no shops other then a recently opened Odin which is just hilariously expensive, or a tiny albert heijn, though that's changing in the next year or so. Oh and heating and hot water is central and an absolute rip off, we have almost 80 euros of fixed costs per month on top of whatever we consume

Just my 2 cents but I'd recommend looking a bit further to the north, around station Noord or Noorderpark. That way you're in the city faster, can park a car more easily, have shops around you that are affordable etc",,,

Pigeon cannibalism,"Hello all,
Just a friendly reminder NOT to feed the pigeons. They're population grows and then theres not enough natural food sources for them. This morning i had the pleasure of walking past a gang of pigeons murdering their fellow brethren, and then proceeded to eat it. This is common when populations get out of control so please do your part to help control the pigeon population and refrain from feeding them!!
Thanks,
A traumatized resident ",223,89,natural_woman_
,In my area in Scotland we have signs at our esplanade waterfront telling us not to feed the seagulls it encourages them. So I'd imagine pigeons would be no different. I just outside my work yesterday saw a seagull eating a dead pigeon. I remember in Trafalgar Square London it was famous for pigeons and you could buy seed to feed them. These got out of control and monuments and buildings would get damage so feeding was banned.  You can actually be fined and prosecuted if caught  although I read that's rare. But they fly a hawk there each day too and a lot of pigeons have been eradicated.,,,
,"disclaimer: not saying we should legalize feeding, just want to give some context. 

a nutritious diet is actually an effective method of population control. when pigeons are malnourished, they crank out as many kids as they can since they don‚Äôt know how much longer they will live. the babies are also malnourished and aren‚Äôt raised by the parents to full term before they move on to the next clutch of eggs. when they are well fed with a proper diet, they only mate in warm seasons and spend twice as long raising offspring to term, then they take some time off instead of immediately doing it again. they spend more time keeping clean and their poops are smaller and more solid. good diet = fewer, healthier pigeons who don‚Äôt eat each other and pollute the streets. 

pigeons are domesticated animals and will ALWAYS be in urban spaces. i think the greater issue is the poor garbage disposal system. Amsterdam streets are always cluttered with bags and it‚Äôs a buffet of horrible, nutrient-poor food. like someone else said, cops don‚Äôt prioritize issuing fines to pigeon feeders. as for the garbage system, THAT is something the municipality can and should fix in my opinion. 

edit: it would also discourage dumpster diving and all of its health and safety risks, which i believe is also illegal 

TLDR: don‚Äôt be too hard on people feeding, we should prioritize better garbage policies.",,,
,Winged rats ..... you wouldnt feed a rat .... dont feed pigeons,,,
,"Pigeons are actually really loving and beautiful birds, although not very smart. I‚Äôve half-domesticated a dozen of them in my garden back in Germany and it really breaks my heart to see the way they live in cities. Still, the dumb birds would rather stay next to the abundance of trash and scraps than live in the nature",,,
,"Another interesting fact about pigeons in Amsterdam, if you pay attention, half if not more of them are missing at least one of their toes. I‚Äôve never noticed this to the same extent in any other city, and I‚Äôve been to BIG cities (Mexico city, New York, Paris, London, Berlin, etc).

,I really wish the council would put up signs in the parks and dam square. This is pure horrifying but also it attracts rats in the parks.,,,
,"I agree if you feed pigeons you should feed them the right seeds, not bread, not nuts, not whatever you‚Äôre snacking on. This can damage their health greatly and their bodies are prone to junk food so much more than us. When food, water are scarce, birds usually don‚Äôt mate nor lay eggs. 

However, It is not normal when population gets out of control in a specie that murder becomes a norm, do you have a source or a study? I believe that scarcity is most of the time man-made or perceived. If you put 10 pigeons in a small cage, yes, they might probably fight until some is dead, put them in a bigger cage, it is all ok again. In the wild, quite rare. 

I spent an equal amount of time with humans as much as I spent taking care of animals. Most animals are more human than us.",,,
,"To better understand them: We domesticated pigeons. They are (nearly) all over the world because humans brought them there. And, they were more than pets. They carried messages. Saved lives in wars (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_pigeon). People race(d) them. They lived spoiled lives as honored human companions for centuries. 

They lost all their survival instincts during the centuries that they lived caged by people.

That is why they live in cities with people instead of in the wild somewhere. It‚Äôs not their fault. And not only did we throw them away, but now humans curse them as ‚Äúwinged rats;‚Äù casting them as pests.

But they don‚Äôt know how to live without us, and their instincts tell us that they should trust us. So, they continue to come up to humans and beg for food, because it‚Äôs the only survival skill left in their genes. 

They love us because they were bred by us to feel that way, and yet we hate them.",,,

Noise from Schiphol in Amstelveen ,"Hi,  
I found a great house for my family and I, but I am worried it will be very noisy because it's relatively close to the direction of the Buitenveldertbaan runway. The location is more or less where the red mark is.

Can anyone advise?

,"All of the houses directly below the runway have gone through a schiphol insulation scheme. Meaning: they have had their roof insulated and special glass/ventilation has been installed to help with the noise.

On a day where it is windy or cloudy, or whatever the reason that they use this runway, you can see the planes are VERY close to the buildings and extremely loud. When you are inside the house, it is very quiet due to the insulation.",,,
,"The runway in question is only used when absolutely necessary, either due to adverse weather or closure of other runways for maintenance. It‚Äôs fairly rare to have a direct flyover ‚Ä¶ but it does happen every now and then, and it is incredibly loud when it happens.

Also: I don‚Äôt get why Amstelveenseweg is after the bend after station Zuid. If the Noord-Zuidlijn gets extended to Schiphol, wouldn‚Äôt is also pass Amstelveenseweg?

For North: there were plans to run the Noordzuid lijn more up to the north aswell having more stations. Sixhaven has a dead end track to turn around, but also had a station planned there. That can still be build in the spot of the dead end.

,"I think the current plan is to extend the Noordzuid lijn through Schiphol to Hoofddorp. I know for a fact it will pass the center of Schiphol on the northern side, so most likely route is via Badhoevedorp on the northern side of the Nieuwe Meer. So unlikely Westwijk will ever be connected.",,,
,"Sixhavens deadend is in between the 2 tracks. Check this repo where they walked from centraal to Damrak and back to sixhavens before the opening:

Don't know exactly why they made a dead end there, as you can switch tracks just before Centraal as well, so when the tunnel is closed it is still possible to run trains from/to centraal.


In the past (until 2007 or such) tram 5 actually went through station Zuid. On Google Street View you can see the metro track splitting away from the tramtrack at Parnassys weg/Gustav Mahler Laan (use historic Streetview!) and the old tramtrack in de Beethovenstraat when you are under the viaduct (2008 Streetview), it shows the remains of the old trough tracks of the tram (between inner ring A10 and train/metro tracks). It also shows new asphalt from where the old tramtracks were. Even the catenary poles are partly there.


When you know where to look, you can find tons of old relics from older trainroutes and tracks in Amsterdam. Have you ever noticed when going from Muiderpoort to Centraal by train, the 2 most Northeastern traintracks (not the IJburgtram 26) drop and raise again?¬†
Or looked at Amstelstation? 1 platform has an hilled edge (outside), the other goes straight down with a wall. The wider platform (normally used to Bijlmer). The glass wall also has an extra opening. That is because where the metros now run, used to be shunting area for sleeper trains with Autotransporters. That is why this opening in the glass wall. Those cars literally ran through the station building and tunnel, can you imagine?",,,
,"That was the plan before the Zuidasdok came into place. Since then, the tunnel voor demolished and this connection is not possible anymore. Don't forget that the current Noordzuidlijn already was planned in 1996! A referendum in 1997 was not valid.¬†


The metros, M5, were delivered between 2012 and 2015. The Zuidasdok plans came in 2012 and line 51 to Westwijk only stopped running in 2019. Theoretically, it could have happened that M5 would do this line, though it cannot run on catenary, so don't know why they made it this way.",,,
,"Thanks!

I'm sorry buddy, but I already knew most of the stuff you told me... the only thing I'm wondering right now is why they made tracks on line 26 from just before the Rietlandpark tunnel to make a curve to the Czaar Peterstraat. Possible ringline again?",,,

I have brought paper home already because the bins were full. I already sent several forms on the website letting them know the bin was full. The way people behave is unbelievable.

At least more bins and more education. And I really hope they have a good recycling system. Most of the papers/cardboards I see are quite if not brand new. The amount of people I see putting very clean papers in front of my building that has only 2 restafval bins is unacceptable. It's 150m (literally a 2-min walk) to the paper bin üôÑ

Grabbing a bite in Amsterdam.,"This a bit of a rant/manifest. Every time I go to Amsterdam I am sort of disappointed by the lack of good and affordable options to grab a bite.
When I go to a show and want to eat something with friends beforehand it seems the best options we can come up with that are somewhat interesting and tasty are Maoz or the vegan junk food bar. Note: it doesn‚Äôt have to be vegan.
This last time we chose to go to Ter Marsch en co on Vijzelstraat.
Garbage. Absolute rip off garbage. The fries were garbage. The ‚Äúburger‚Äù was garbage. I had the classic chicken burger. Anyone can make a better burger than that. The bun was a stale ‚Äúbrioche‚Äù type bun..
The waitresses were cool.
I feel ripped off by them. In hindsight I should‚Äôve sent back the meager portion of fries which tasted old but for reasons I cannot fully explain I didn‚Äôt. I was too hungry.

Before choosing that spot we had weighed our options going to one of the countless restaurants near the Leidscheplein. But none of it really seemed any good. In hindsight I wish we had.

My question is: where between Central Station and Leidseplein(or within the vicinity of Leidseplein) are the actual good spots to grab a bite? 

The only good thing I ate in Amsterdam that days was an Oatly soft serve.

Im seriously appalled by the fact that the area around Leidseplein has become(always been in my lifetime but seems to be worse every time) such a hollowed out tourist centered husk of money grabbing nothingness.

I believe in you Amsterdam. Lets ‚Äútake it back‚Äù and put some heart back into that area.  
Real food and real people ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Edit:
Spelling.

I would like to add that Im not a tourist(or an expat). The area we‚Äôre talking about makes me feel like I am one though! Hopefully its going to change for the better in the future.
I got some great suggestion already. But could definitely use more.
Thanks!",0,80,gilllesdot
,"The problem is that you're in tourist central trying to get a good deal. 

You can get good food in:
Noord - if you take the ferry across
West - if you go towards Bilderdijk/Kinkerstraat (De Hallen for example)
East:  if you go towards Oosterpark or Indische buurt.
South: towards de Pijp

For example: Dam Square. Endless shit in every direction. But right there, in a location that looks like it would be awful, is FuLu Mandarijn, serving some incredible Sichuan style food which is actually spicy not Dutch spicy. 

Or: Leidseplein. Between yet another Argentinian Steakhouse or mediocre 'italian' with people in the door shouting at you to come in... There's Sherpa which is an excellent Nepalese restaurant serving great quality and interesting dishes.",,,

It is Albert Cuypstraat 75 area.

In the 70s there were a lot of accidents in that area. So they protested to force the municipality to do something about it. Mc Donalds is on the left side. And behind on the right hand side is the Metro exit.

feels impossible to get a job,"I'm 19 years old from the EU and I live in Amsterdam. I applied to countless minimum wage jobs here that require no experience and no dutch- hotels, restaurants, retail, etc. They all ghosted me except for one hotel that rejected me within two days. What am I doing wrong? Any advice on how to get a minimum wage job? I'm not picky about the shifts, I can work on the weekends. My only preference is that I would prefer not to get a zero hour contract job unless I have no other choice. I think my CV is decent, I have experience working as a barista back in my home country.

You can also try studiejob or other agencies that looking for student/part-time workers.",,,
,"Try werk.nl. 
Or bijbaan.nl.

There's a book called ""what color is your parachute"" which gives really good advice. The job market is counter intuitive- most vacancies never even get advertised, they are given to people who know someone already, or who make a connection. So use your own contacts to do that; tell people you're looking for a job. 

I think most places in NL won't use linkedin for entry level jobs. And won't use glassdoor at all.

I think also at your age, with very little experience and no Dutch, you're probably going to get a zero hours contract. They're not the worst thing in the world, I've had a few. Some people even have more than one. So long as the flexibility works for *you*, not just for your employer.

You can apply to these companies that I've worked for, or know people who have worked for them, without speaking Dutch: 
- flink
- uber eats 
- McDonald's 
- Burger King 
- Sandd 
- Party Hands 

You'll probably have the best luck applying directly to large and mid-sized companies, and tourist focused companies.

Do you use a cover letter? What‚Äôs in it? It should be a short, positive and motivated letter showing why you would be a good match. Though a cover letter isn‚Äôt necessary for most minimum wage jobs, it could help you stand out. Stick to maximum half a page.

100% Definitely there. The window pattern on the left matches up, look for the triangular element above the door behind the left guy's shoulder. You'll find it here too if you veer off the bridge and onto the left side of the canal, and then all the successive window patterns also match.

Er is geen wet die vlaggen verbiedt of bepaalt hoe u moet vlaggen. U bent dus nooit strafbaar als u de vlag uithangt.

Rant about bunq bank as an ex-employee.,"Rant about bunq as an ex-employee.

In my 10 years of career working in 3 other multinational banks, I have never seen a shit bank like this.

Work culture:
This company don‚Äôt have soul. People don‚Äôt talk to each other. All of them on a constant fear of getting laid off. There is a 9-6 shift and you are expected to work after 6. If you leave on time, it is frond upon. No proper training in given to the new joiners. They just dump a bunch of documents to read and 5 hr long video to watch. After this they expect a >95% quality. No guidance is given while doing your task, no proper feed is given to you for your mistakes. The overall vibe in the office is like someone was killed yesterday and now they don‚Äôt know who will be next. I have worked there so I know. Everyday its someone‚Äôs last day and every Friday you will see a new face. Its like a fucking saloon swing door. People coming and going.

Product:
I have worked there and used their services. The whole company is just working to make their app more shiny and improve the number of customers and deposits every day. There is no consideration for the services they provide. There is no customer service. People are complaining left right and centre and all the people are worried about the image of the CEO and the brand name of the company. A girl (press officer) was fires recently just because she was unable to defend the CEO on social media for the number of fraud happening in bunq. What action did they take to prevent fraud? ZERO.

CEO and High ranking people:
I have never talked to the CEO. But all i have heard that he is a fucking narcissistic person. All he cares about is money and his reputation. He doesn‚Äôt give damm about anyone. For the people on top, they are the same. 

Future of bunq as a bank:
The future of bank is grim, i can tell from my 10 years of experience. IDK who have given a banking license to this bank. They are not complying with the policy of the regulators (as a employee I can tell you that). I don‚Äôt see this bank surviving in next 10 years. They will be heavily fined by the regulators for not following proper policy and procedures. 

My recommendation is that don‚Äôt use bunq as your primary bank. Don‚Äôt keep large amounts in your account. It will be a sane decision to pull your money out and close your account. If not just use it for daily use not more than that.

When on a random Wednesday they locked my account with all my money on it, obviously I freaked out and That's when I found out that they didn't have customer service and I had to go to Twitter and rant about it for them to help me. 
It took them almost a week to figure it out, I have contacted the Dutch CB and they said they couldn't help me, that my issue was not on their scope.

We met leaving the toilet and washing our hands, I was first and used like 3/4 paper towels to dry my hands. He (right after me) politely said: 

-hey, may I show you something?

He shaked his wet hands against the sink counting until 6... proceeded to take 1 paper towel, folded in 2 and dried his hands with 1 (whereas I used 3 or 4 lol). 

- ""this is how you can save on paper"" (smiles üòä) 

It was a super smooth interaction. 

I didn't get the job and I don't follow up their updates (I have bunq with my partner) + Revolut as bank, Revolut is being better lately.

,"Man, glad I left. Absolutely used to love them at first, as they by far had the best banking experience out there. They totally ruined their own company, and it's super clear to end users when it happened too.

With the first / V2 redesign, they were so ecstatic about the redesign and how great it was, despite shit full out being broken or being super confusing compared with the old version. Everyone I talked to about it disliked it, but nobody really hated it enough to leave yet at that point; it was still a banking app, just not an intuitive one. Felt like they hired a designer out of high school and forgot to tell them what they're working on.

Then they started entering the German, Spanish, Italian and other European markets, and the whole app was redesigned again to a V3, which they announced in this really cringe Apple-esque keynote way together with steep pricing increases (and mortgage offerings or something?)

This third version wasn't just confusing, but it actively felt like a travel app, not like a banking app: Every other button lead to this ""community"" thing, which had user to be this small subsection that was somewhat of a decent-ish addition in V1/V2, but was now made to be the primary focus. The fact that you could do banking with this travel app, wasn't a secondary feature,but maybe a third or even a fourth.

If you needed help with anything, you couldn't just reach out to them anymore either, but were forced to go through this ""Q&A questionnaire"" by ""asking"" a question on this community forums thing, and even if you managed to skip it by being lucky enough that your question wasn't deemed ""community"" appropriate enough, they'd still take over a day to respond, whereas with V1 and V2 it was hours at worst.


Additionally, with them having launched in other countries by this point and failing to separate this ""community"" thing into localised forums, it effectively felt like an early-2000's forum, where people were dumping questions in like six different languages, making it feel like you were looking at some abandoned, bot-ridden and dangerous spam website.

That was the straw that broke my back, and I switched to ABN the same day.

This is just Bitcoin-fanatic drivel which ignores everything I‚Äôve said. 

Real currency represents the value of an entire country‚Äôs economy and the financial viability of its government. The value of any given currency responds to real world events. The dollar is strong now because the US economy is doing well. If the US economy collapsed, the value of the dollar would go down. While no market is perfect, it‚Äôs a relatively rational valuation. Every US person and company needs to pay US taxes, in dollars. If the US economy and government are huge and strong, there will always be a huge demand for dollars. 

In contrast, crypto‚Äôs ‚Äúvalue‚Äù is linked to nothing except the imagination of its participants. It goes up and down based on hype, and nothing else. There is literally nothing which makes Bitcoin ‚Äúworth‚Äù more than Dogecoin except for the continuation of the ‚Äúgreater fool‚Äù chain. It will inevitably collapse at some point and there will be a lot of bag holders - possibly when Binance inevitably collapses in the foreseeable future.

Inflation exists, yes. 

> So yes, if you have your hard earned money, you spent a good part of your day earning in a savings account that has interest rates a fraction of true inflation rates you are being robbed.

Vaguely correct, but for the silly emotive language. You can also lose your entire bitcoin ‚Äúvalue‚Äù in minutes if everyone realises it‚Äôs bullshit. Crypto generally is one of the most laughably volatile ‚Äúassets‚Äù in existence. So if your point is that a particular thing is bad because its value fluctuates‚Ä¶ weird argument for a crypto fanatic. 

> You don't need to work in finance to know why rich people own assets, not currencies.

Quite right. The most successful investors mainly own shares, bonds, and real estate. Thats what I do too, personally. 

> If only there was a currency that worked both as a deflationary asset and as a currency that was decentralized and not dictated by the rich and powerful... hmm...

Crypto isn‚Äôt a currency, it‚Äôs an imaginary commodity with no practical use. And the value of the US dollar or a Vodafone share isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdictated by the rich and powerful‚Äù any more than Bitcoin lol.

Odido glass fiber and Open Dutch Network,"Hello,

like I suspect many of you, I received a visit from Odido to change my internet connection from Ziggo to Odido glass fiber.

A couple of months ago they came and placed some cables out of all the front doors in the street.

Now they say someone will come within 2 months to have the glass fiber connected.

  
Now my question: I live on floor 2, where there is a meterkast. How are they going to come up two floors? Will they break/drill stuff? I saw other posts in other cities where they did a terrible job. We just renovated the house and the thought of having somebody coming here and just hacking/drilling makes me sick.

Has the installation happened to you in Amsterdam already? How good of a job was done?

Rotterdam at least has a transit system built around a functional city center.


Paris, London, NYC are all significantly better for city base transit.",,,
,"Are you sure it was Amsterdam? Been using it for 12 years and it‚Äôs notably gotten worse. 

Let‚Äôs do some examples:
a) Morning rush hour (08:00-09:00), 50 from Gein to Isolatorweg: for some reason GVB uses the short trains for these rides. Goes every 10 minutes. Completely full at Bijlmer Arena. I‚Äôm lucky I get in at the start of the line. Often skips a ride. 

b) there hasn‚Äôt been a single day that the 24 or 3 ran a perfect schedule. Consistently late (especially the 3), always too full during rush hours, GVB refuses to deploy more trains on the 3 route while it‚Äôs notably too crowded for a good 2/3 hours in the afternoon/early evening. 

c) Afternoon/early evening rush hour, 50 from Isolatorweg to Gein: always full and again use of the short wagons.

d) a week or two ago I tried to go from Wibautstraat to Gein. 53 not running at all. 54 took 20 minutes to arrive. Once arrived, we were notified that the train did not run past Spaklerweg and that you had to take the bus to van der Madeweg. Train was COMPLETELY full. Only one of the doors out (at the station) was working. Bus completely full too.

The thing is Rotterdam (and Amsterdam) have barely no metro, which is by far the fastest mode of transportation within a city. Trams are alright, but they are simply slower.

,"Yes incidents and traffic jams happen everywhere. My point was that most visitors / tourists have better experience of Dutch public transport than the residents do because of a few factors:

- Short length of stay. If you‚Äôre here just for one week, the chances of you running into metro/train chaos is very small compared to those who live here year round.

- Limited reach. Most tourists doesn‚Äôt feel disruption around Schiphol that much because for them that is their starting point or final destination. If you had to commute between Amsterdam-Leiden or Amsterdam-Rotterdam you notice trains being late or cancelled much more. This was my point with the Spaklerweg incident.

- Urgence levels. Residents have somewhere to be, but most leisure visitors won‚Äôt stress out over being late by 15-30 minutes. In the last year I got into office or class late a few times because whole metro or tram gets cancelled or simply didn‚Äôt show up.
