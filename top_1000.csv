Motorcycle/car noise in IJburg,"Hey Folks!

As someone who is living in IJburg (close to IJburglaan) for a while now, I noticed a lot of motorcyclists and car drivers who use the long street to speed up and cause extreme noise and thus nuisance, even easily noticeable with closed window and often in the evening, almost every day.

Is there any chance to do ""something about it"" (speed bumps, more controls or similar), or is it just bad luck?",5,3,eVoliumTV

,"Yessss more speed bumps!

God I hate expats.",,,
I got assaulted at Cafe Oranje in West and I need the videos,"Hello, I‚Äôm using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I was assaulted and beat up by three men at Cafe Oranje in the bar yesterday during the Netherlands and Romania match. They were bullying me and my girlfriend and when I asked them to be respectful they responded by pushing me outside and started beating me on my face and knocking me out while still beating me toll I was unconscious and had to be taken away by the ambulance. They also tore my girlfriend‚Äôs clothes. 

I understand there were witnesses there, and I hope I can get some of the videos or pictures that were taken there. 

I was knocked out and my girlfriend was in shock so we didn‚Äôt have a chance to get the videos from people, but I‚Äôm hoping someone might see it here. I‚Äôm not sure if the police got the videos from the witnesses, because when I called them the number said they didn‚Äôt know. The police non-emergency number dumbly actually told me to go back to the same place to try and get the video from people or the cafe, yeah right.

Also, any videos that were taken during the game would be of real help! We know what these people look like and can identify them. Maybe there‚Äôs the off chance that they were filmed before this happened and we can use that with the police to identify them.  

I think will be able to use this video to find the suspects who assaulted me and bring them to justice. Please send if you were there. Thank you in advance. 

Also, any advice is welcome. I got a lawyer who is my friend‚Äôs dad who offered to represent us for free.

Update: I want to thank you all for your very helpful replies and kind words. It is indeed a traumatic experience. I have received one video so far (literally of me being knocked out) and will go to the police to add it to my statement and the report. If you were there or have any videos, please send me a dm. I‚Äôll buy you a beer for it :) 

Second update: 
I called the bar. One of the women picked up and said they didn‚Äôt have cameras. I told them I have a video of the people punching me, and maybe could use their help identifying these people. They said they can‚Äôt help and it‚Äôs bad for business. They said if it happened inside it would have been a different story, but it happened outside. So they said they can‚Äôt really help. The incident actually started inside, I was pushed inside to the outside of the bar and I was assaulted right next to the chairs that belong to the bar on their terrace basically, which is on the street.

During the incident, however, when things were escalating and I tried to get the man who was bartending involved I asked him ‚Äúwho are these people and why are they treating me like this?‚Äù he said ‚Äúthese people are regulars.‚Äù Should I go to the barman and ask him who these people were? Or should I leave this up to the police? Maybe they can take the video and actually do their job of finding these people? How much do I need to take matters into my own hands?",700,157,Throwaway-Adam
,"So sorry to hear about what happened to you . . . horrific.

May or may not be an obvious suggestion, but perhaps contacting the caf√© staff on duty that day could help with identifying the men? Perhaps they paid by card and their names are on record?",,,

My friend recorded the incident on his phone, including license plate number. He called the police, who showed up after the attacker left.

,"How did it happen? can you tell the whole story? Are you Romanian? How did the conflict arise? It's somewhat odd for Dutch Oranje fans in a small cafe to start beating up on one guy and especially just one dude who's with his gf just out of the blue. You just asked them to be respectful and they immediately proceeded to jump you? Were you all drunk?   
It's fucked that three dudes jumped you and no one helped out. Usually people try to break it up at least.  
Were they caucasian or mixed ethnicity?  
I'm asking because depending on the severity of your ""injuries"" you may want to let it go. It was just a fight.  
Or go back and look for them and if you find them tell them to man up and square up one on one.  
The police are usually useless and very reluctant to make a case as to them it was just a fight and they are understaffed.   
Like I said, it all depends on the severity of your injuries and I'm guessing they are no that bad.  
I know, many snowflakes here will disagree and downvote me but I live in the real world and have fought and many times you just let it go. It's not worth your energy. Even if they catch them the penalty's are a joke.  
Probably some community service IF that.  
It's important to note that if everyone was drunk it's a very different scenario than if everyone was sober.  
Two very different worlds.  
This is why I don't drink alcohol and stay away from drunk people.  


ps. You've responded to others now and ""confirming"" it was a very traumatic experience, but it's only as traumatic as you want it to be. I'm trying to help you by advising you to let it go. Don't be a victim other than just a victim of life and existence.   
Man up so to speak and see it as just another fight or maybe even your first. It happens.   
Either that OR pursue it but realize it will cause lots and lots of stress and may no be worth it plus there will be a price to pay.   
Me, personally being nuts, I would go back to the cafe every day or as much as I can. I'd look for them if I'm feeling vengeful.   
Def don't do this, but I'm guessing you're not that type anyways.  
  
Why don't you go back to the cafe to at least ask for some info to track down those dudes?",,,

The police will follow up and decide what to do. Also keep in mind that people on the footage can make a case against  you related to breach of portrait rights and defamation in case you are watching, storing or spreading (social media) the images of security cameras.

,"Excellent idea, but actually for another reason. According to AVG (dutch privacy laws) only police or other official instances etc can 'legally get a hold of camera footage, esp when it comes from businesses. I know this because I was in a car accident that led to a big insurance dispute. Getting the footage was extremely difficult. There was a coffee shop with a ton of cameras where it happened. They were super nice (bc they were my neighbors)  and saved the footage for me on a USB before it got automatically deleted. But to have it be released for the case was a bureaucratic shit hole. It took weeks of bothering the insurance company, until I finally just begged the shop to just give the USB to me so I could send the footage myself. Which thankfully they did but only bc of goodwill bc I knew them. 
So go to the bar, they will definitely remember and probably very willing to help but might not be able to immediately bc of the AVG laws. Ask the personel there to get the owner involved and save the footage at least. If they are wishy washy keep pushing, footage generally gets deleted 7-30 days. And push the police too to retrieve the footage. Its essential!! 

Something horrible happened to you, the people who did it need to be brought to justice. I know you're probably still hurting a lot but when it comes to video proof time is of the essence. Also contact AT5, keep an eye on Dumpert etc etc. Besides the bars footage as you said, there will defo have been bystanders.",,,

So I‚Äôm curious, which country would you call not racist?

I agree it‚Äôs an issue we should work on, and it‚Äôs good to try to make Dutch people aware that our country is certainly not perfect, even though Dutch people might think it is. But if you‚Äôre truly interested in improving the situation, calling an entire country racist is not the way to go about it.

,"I agree with you both but I would like to point out that there is a Long Covid crisis that most governments are trying to hide, if you look at the unions for nurses e.g. in England they have been screaming and warning for two years now that many nurses are disabled or can't return to work because of Long Covid. 

I won't spam you all with this but you can look at sick leaves data.in many countries. In the Netherlands some healthcare workers demanded compensations because many of them developed Long Covid as well, some union members talked on the radio (not during peak hour sadly).

If you wanna know more Harvard (with David Cutler) are measuring the impact of the pandemic, and whilr you don't see many deaths anymore, there are millions of people in each country who get Long Covid, the risk is more or less around 15-25% depending on so many factors, but everyone is at risk. Especially workers who are exposed to crowds a lot, so that's why you see understaffed departments in hospitals, healthcare settings, firemen, police officers (in some countries the police actually got rekt a lot, and surprise that's where the amount of anti maskers and antivaxxers were significant too, like in some US states e.g.)

So yes unions can say that they understaffed as excuse sometimes but the past few years, since 2020 actually, they have been hit hard with sickness.

Many economists and medical historians warned the world about this in 2020 by the way, you have the Pandemic Economics papers funded by the EU (some of my professors even published there üòÑ), and other hundreds of scientists who published on Nature reminding us that there is always an increase in disability following a pandemic (and considering we are not really in the post period you can do the maths).

Amsterdam overtourism: City moves to ban cruise ships,,414,103,guyoffthegrid
,"‚ÄúAmsterdam is taking new steps to fight back against overtourism by launching plans to relocate its passenger cruise terminal to outside of the city centre.

‚Äã‚ÄãBy 2035, none of the boats will be able to dock in the iconic capital.

Currently, the amount permitted is 190, but that‚Äôs slated to go down to a maximum of 100 from 2026.

It‚Äôs been agreed that Rotterdam in the south will take more than 40 ships not welcome in Amsterdam from 2026.

However, the war on tourists in Amsterdam has been so wildly mismanaged, the municipality has been great at mismanagement. We live in an open-air museum and we need income to pay for the insane cost of keeping it all the same. Tourism is a great way to generate that income. However, we should focus on making it more expensive for tourists and leveraging that, any other method of reducing tourists doesn‚Äôt work.",,,

,"This is a bit of a reversal of what is actually going on. What is going on is that the city thinks new bridges in Oost and West are more important than some tall cruise ships. So a new location for the cruise terminal was being looked at and only Coenhaven was deemed suitable enough. If it's too expensive or it doesn't work out, then too bad, no more big cruise ships. Taking all this account there is also a limited willingness to invest in the cruise tourism industry since it's seen as environmentally harmful and superfluous (not like we need the tourism with the records that keep getting broken).

Absolutely insane take. We're keeping the city in good order and condition because that's the right thing to do. It's what we always have done and what other non-touristy Dutch towns also do. What the humongous amounts of visitors to our city do is increase the cleaning budget through the roof. Also note that we have police capacity allocated by The Hague based on the number of residents, those millions of tourists a year are not counted, but they do get involved in a lot of crime as well (either targeted or participating). The city has been begging The Hague for years now.

Most of the revenue to locals comes from services which the cruise ship tourists don't use. Local transport, dining in local restaurants, etc.

,"It's on the contrary widely documented that cruise ship tourists are the ones generating the least revenue for the local economy of the place they visit. Most of these tourists just do a guided tour, buy a few souvenirs and that's it. This is the worst in my opinion. They are labelled as hit and run tourists. See examples of Venice as evidence, and given quote: https://www.euronews.com/travel/2023/05/13/ive-lived-in-venice-for-8-years-why-do-i-see-see-cruise-ships-here-when-theyve-been-banned

I'm sorry but I'm tired of hearing the defense ""Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean you can tell others not to do it.""  They're damaging the ocean and environment.  I don't tell people not to do things that don't affect me.  This affects us all negatively.

,"I have no idea how they do it in Rotterdam. As far as I know in Amsterdam, the river cruises (smaller ships not the huge one) for example have guided tours in the city. They use public transport to travel through the city and visit museums, restaurants etc. If they are docked for two days, they will visit the city and are visiting shops and local restaurants. Besides that the guides are also local people, I‚Äôve never seen a group of young people from the UK taking a guided tour or visit a museum. They are focused on partying and spending the least possible and visit the big (candy)stores in the Kalverstraat.

In my opinion if they want to solve the problem of overtourism, start with Airbnb. The amount of flights coming in from the UK is insane. A good amount of these people are the ones that see Amsterdam as a big party jungle and don‚Äôt show respect to the city nor the people. 

After being more strict on Airbnb and it is still a problem - I agree, start with the deducting the amount of cruises.",,,

I know it's a long shot but it would be such a waste to let them be unused and I have no friends there

Her work explores body art, endurace, the relationship between the performer and audience, the limits of the body, and the possibilities of the mind. Being active for over four decades, Abramoviƒá refers to herself as the ""grandmother of performance art. She pioneered a new notion of identity by bringing in the participation of observers, focusing on ""confronting pain, blood, and physical limits of the body""
