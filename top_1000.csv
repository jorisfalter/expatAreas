"Who needs ‚Ç¨56,05 food voucher?","For work I order a lot of food trough thuisbezorgd. This has earned me a ‚Ç¨56,05 voucher for food from Lila. They do great wraps, salads and humus bowls. I could fill my freezer, but I eat well at work and rather give this voucher to someone who needs it.

So; who does? Let me know in the comments. It would be preferable if someone would share it with others.

They way it works is that I send you the voucher code and you'd order trough thuisbezorgd.

,"Heel irritant om wakker te worden gehouden door voetbalfans die tot 02:00 zitten te toeteren, dat is gewoon ronduit asociaal en ik keur het af en het is niet meer dan logisch om daar verontwaardigd over te zijn.

Toch valt het mij wel op dat er een stuk minder verontwaardiging lijkt te zijn als fans van Nederlandse voetbalclubs het voor de zoveelste keer te bont maken. Als Marokko een keer de halve finale van het WK haalt, zijn er landelijk 30 aanhoudingen en wordt het in de media (niet onterecht) een onrustige nacht genoemd. Een paar maanden later werd Feyenoord kampioen en waren er rondom de 'feestelijkheden' een stuk of honderd aanhoudingen, maar daarover werd in de media geschreven dat het meeviel en rustiger dan verwacht verliep.

Amsterdam overtourism: City moves to ban cruise ships,,315,85,guyoffthegrid
,"‚ÄúAmsterdam is taking new steps to fight back against overtourism by launching plans to relocate its passenger cruise terminal to outside of the city centre.

‚Äã‚ÄãBy 2035, none of the boats will be able to dock in the iconic capital.

[ ‚Ä¶ ]

Currently, the amount permitted is 190, but that‚Äôs slated to go down to a maximum of 100 from 2026.

It‚Äôs been agreed that Rotterdam in the south will take more than 40 ships not welcome in Amsterdam from 2026.

[ ‚Ä¶ ]

By 2027, any boats in the Amsterdam terminal will be required to use shore power only to lessen their environmental impact.‚Äù",,,
,Good.  I would love to see the cruise ship industry just disappear in my lifetime.,,,
,How about first the fucking 100 candy shops and ice bakeries . Amsterdam lost it's identify long ago¬†,,,
,"Any ban on cruise ships I‚Äôm onboard with, the big ones emit the same NOx & SOx annually as about 9 million cars. The thing people need to live or see a loved one, cruise ships are genuinely the worst thing we have and the fact that we don‚Äôt completely ban them is a crime.

However, the war on tourists in Amsterdam has been so wildly mismanaged, the municipality has been great at mismanagement. We live in an open-air museum and we need income to pay for the insane cost of keeping it all the same. Tourism is a great way to generate that income. However, we should focus on making it more expensive for tourists and leveraging that, any other method of reducing tourists doesn‚Äôt work.",,,
,Lol their just docking in zaandam now and putting the people on busses to Amsterdam,,,
,"It's indefensible to ban a 2006 VW Golf from entering the inner city, but not the large swaths of cruise ships that spew far more pollutants into the air.",,,
,"I don‚Äôt care about the amount, but I love nearby and the smoke is so fucking unhealthy from these ships. So glad to hear they will need to use shore power from 2026. Although I‚Äôm sure deadlines won‚Äôt be met.",,,
,Cruise ships will dock a bit further and just use touringcars at that point,,,
,"They are targetting the wrong tourists. People on the cruises are the ones that are actually interested in Dutch culture (they visit museums, restaurants etc.) and treat the city with respect. These people have paid a lot for these cruises and are willing to pay good money for activities in the city.

The problem are the young people flying in with a budget airline, stay in an Airbnb for a weekend with a group, get high and drunk at the same time, puke in the streets and don‚Äôt spend a penny on any cultural activities besides a canal tour and Madame Tussauds. The governments needs to look at a city like Barcelona how they are fighting these tourists.",,,
,Get rid of all the duck stores as well please,,,
,"This is a bit of a reversal of what is actually going on. What is going on is that the city thinks new bridges in Oost and West are more important than some tall cruise ships. So a new location for the cruise terminal was being looked at and only Coenhaven was deemed suitable enough. If it's too expensive or it doesn't work out, then too bad, no more big cruise ships. Taking all this account there is also a limited willingness to invest in the cruise tourism industry since it's seen as environmentally harmful and superfluous (not like we need the tourism with the records that keep getting broken). So that means only limited amount of ""walstroom"" (electric power supply rather than spouting highly toxic fumes into the air) will be available. No access to walstroom, no access at all. That's the ""ban"" we're talking about.",,,

,"This is every major city in Europe, started in London a decade or more ago now every high street in England is. Barbers, American candy, bookies, pawn shop, western money laundering services and a few more barbers. Those rubber duck shops are starting to increase. It‚Äôs not that people don‚Äôt want small business it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs too expensive for normal people to pay rents. If you have cash to lose you can afford super high rentals. I walked past that big candy store in Amsterdam (opposite or just up from Albert Heine local) and the rubber duck shop about twenty times last week and never saw a soul in there? How do they pay rent? Cash is king! If Amsterdam got rid of tourists completely that would be bad for the city however getting away from the piss heads who come to cause agro 100 percent. Xxx",,,

,"Hardly the cause.

Tourism exploded following the 2008 Financial Crisis when the city government needed to make up budget shortfalls due to cuts in funding from central government.

I would expect a similar story for most major Eurooean cities such as Berlin and Barcelona.",,,
,"If that was due to tourists only, Paris the most visited city in the world would be full of those and it's just not the case. There's another reason",,,
,"There's a limit to how much the city can control what people sell in their shops. The tragedy is, a lot of bakeries and restaurants in that area used to be good but were forced to cater to tourists when they found themselves surrounded by tourist shops. When there's fewer ""low quality"" tourists, or they're more spread out, and locals start going to the center again (as we ought to be doing currently, there's still some places there absolutely worth going to), perhaps it can change.",,,

,">¬†the big ones emit the same CO2 annually as about 9 million cars


I believe that figure is true for SOx and NOx, not CO2. Nevertheless, I agree with your point.¬†


Cruise ships are basically highly polluting diarrhea prisons.¬†",,,
,Seeing cruise ships on geiranger is such an atrocity. Amsterdam need to stop cruise ships,,,
,"> and we need income to pay for the insane cost of keeping it all the same. 

Absolutely insane take. We're keeping the city in good order and condition because that's the right thing to do. It's what we always have done and what other non-touristy Dutch towns also do. What the humongous amounts of visitors to our city do is increase the cleaning budget through the roof. Also note that we have police capacity allocated by The Hague based on the number of residents, those millions of tourists a year are not counted, but they do get involved in a lot of crime as well (either targeted or participating). The city has been begging The Hague for years now.   

> Tourism is a great way to generate that income.   

Meh. It's costing us a lot. Both in actual money and in culture and social cohesion.",,,
,Yeah but the 2006 doesn't bring in the money like the cruise ship ofc,,,
,"The problem is that the city gets very little revenue from cruise passengers, but the costs associated with a large number of people are borne by the city.

Most of the revenue to locals comes from services which the cruise ship tourists don't use. Local transport, dining in local restaurants, etc.

https://www.eur.nl/en/news/cruise-ships-rotterdam-not-profitable are the numbers for Rotterdam.",,,
,"It's on the contrary widely documented that cruise ship tourists are the ones generating the least revenue for the local economy of the place they visit. Most of these tourists just do a guided tour, buy a few souvenirs and that's it. This is the worst in my opinion. They are labelled as hit and run tourists. See examples of Venice as evidence, and given quote: https://www.euronews.com/travel/2023/05/13/ive-lived-in-venice-for-8-years-why-do-i-see-see-cruise-ships-here-when-theyve-been-banned
As passengers tend to eat and sleep on the ship, they contribute relatively little to the historic city‚Äôs economy while weighing heavily on its infrastructure and resources.",,,
,People on those ships will not pay for food or hotels since both are included in the cruise. So they will buy some shitty merch from a tourist store and that's it. Maybe visit a museum.,,,

,"I have no idea how they do it in Rotterdam. As far as I know in Amsterdam, the river cruises (smaller ships not the huge one) for example have guided tours in the city. They use public transport to travel through the city and visit museums, restaurants etc. If they are docked for two days, they will visit the city and are visiting shops and local restaurants. Besides that the guides are also local people, I‚Äôve never seen a group of young people from the UK taking a guided tour or visit a museum. They are focused on partying and spending the least possible and visit the big (candy)stores in the Kalverstraat.

In my opinion if they want to solve the problem of overtourism, start with Airbnb. The amount of flights coming in from the UK is insane. A good amount of these people are the ones that see Amsterdam as a big party jungle and don‚Äôt show respect to the city nor the people. 

After being more strict on Airbnb and it is still a problem - I agree, start with the deducting the amount of cruises.",,,

I found my stolen bike! Now what?,"Alright so, about a year ago I had the universal Amsterdam experience of having my bike stolen- I'd left it with only the back lock on, in front of my uni building in broad daylight for about 3 hours. It was a crappy bike that had very recently been fixed- new chain, new wheel- and most importantly it was painted bright purple/blue, I honestly couldn't belive it was stolen in these circumstances- but i shouldn't have underestimated Amsterdam.

This morning I saw it again, parked by Zuid, its back lock open but tied up with a chain. It's 100% the same one, down to the bell and two little red zip ties on the back. I couldn't stop long since I had to catch a train, and it probably won't be there again tonight.

What should I do in this situation, if i see it again? I definitley don't wanna call the cops, and honestly I have very little hope of seeing it again, but still, if anyone has any ideas of what I should do in this situation I'd appreciate any advice. :))

Any repairs done by the person who bought it should be reimbursed by the person who owned it before it got stolen (again bills required etc. 
- if its longer then 5 years the bike is now legally fully owned by the new owner. 

In reality the cops aren‚Äôt going to come for a stolen bike (but if you happen to catch one on the street they might help you). So you can put another lock on it with a note explaining the above and that you will call a cop if they don‚Äôt remove their lock.

De reden dat het terugnemen van je eigen fiets hier niet onder valt, is dat revindicatie een rechtmatige en wettelijk geregelde bevoegdheid is van de eigenaar (art. 5:2 BW).
