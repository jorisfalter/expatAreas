People also hurt her, they kicked her and threw stones at her.  For a long time I tried to find her a home so that she would be safe, but no one responded, no one liked her and no one wanted to give her a home.  \ud83d\ude14 Then she became very seriously ill, she could not walk, did not eat, was on the verge of life and death, and we took her to the clinic, where she was prescribed a lot of medications.  We moved to Phuket and took her with us, where we treated her and fought for her life, finally she fully recovered, she began to trust us, but the fear of other people and dogs remained.  She has all her vaccinations, her veterinarian's passport, she is spayed, we give anti-parasite medication every month, she has a microchip and a large dog carrier for travel.  She was supposed to fly to a new home on April 26, but at the last moment people refused and now she is looking for a home again.  She is 1 year and 3 months old, weighs 15 kg, medium size.  She is a kind girl, loves to play with toys, loves to run around the yard, loves to play with water.  She had no childhood, only fear, she did not live, but survived, and now she deserves a wonderful life in a loving family and finally find her forever home.\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udfe1\ud83d\ude07",

There are plenty of hotels from cheap to expensive. If you like to swim book a hotel with a pool as that time of year swimming on the beach can be dangerous some days, especially for your four-year-old. There are plenty of places to eat both Thai and Western food. Kata has everything you need. There are no \"safe beaches\" on Phuket that time of year. The waves come from the south west and hit all the west coast beaches the same. It's safe as far as community goes but it's not safe to swim unless you're an excellent swimmer. Surfing is good that time of year.",

She is 1 year and 4 months old, weighs 15 kg, sterilized, has all vaccinations, has monthly anti-parasitic measures, has a chip and a large carrier for traveling or traveling to another country.  She was born on the street in Pattaya, from childhood she was not accepted by other dogs, she was often bitten, she constantly hid from everyone, both from people and from dogs.  I fed her every day separately from everyone else.  After she got very sick and was on the verge of life and death, she walked staggering, had green snot and a high temperature, I took her from the street for treatment and took her to Phuket.  A month later she was completely healthy and now she is really looking for a home and her family.  She is a very kind girl, loves to play and run outside, but is still a little afraid of people and other dogs due to her sad past, so she will need some training to get rid of her fears.  I really ask you to help find her the best home\ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude07",

Having said that, if you're interest is going to Phi Phi, that's fine, you can go there all year around, there is always somewhere protected from the wind and waves (if there are any.) Racha or Raya Island is also nice that time of year, the boats can handle the weather most days, though I wouldn't book a speedboat trip in advance, just wait until you get here and book it then when you know the weather. There are plenty of tour operators doing these trips. Also Phang Nga Bay to the east of Phuket has many islands (though the snorkeling is not good) and you can visit these islands year around as well. You'll be fine, just don't book anything in advance.",

We moved to Phuket, now I am completely healthy and looking for a loving and caring family.  \ud83e\udd70I am 1 year and 4 months old, weight 15 kg, I am of average height.  I am treated for parasites monthly, have all my vaccines, have a microchip and a large travel carrier.  I am still afraid of strangers and dogs because of my street background.  But despite these characteristics, I am a very kind girl and I really like to run outside, I like to play with toys, I like to play with water in a basin.  If suddenly I have fallen into your soul and heart and you want to give me a permanent home, and you are ready to work with me so that I am no longer afraid of other dogs and people, then I will be happy if you come and meet me\ud83d\ude07\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude07\ud83e\udd70",

I've lived in Thailand for 14 years and have never experienced online booking customer service at this level from start to finish, PLUS excellent prices. I asked a LOT of questions \ud83e\udd26 and nothing was too much trouble and was always messaged back super fast. You can see the tone by the screenshots of emails I got.\n\nWe booked 2 tours (NOTE: we had own transportation so prices on the links do not include hotel transfers):\n\n*Private lake tour for 3 people (5 hours including Coral cave with local guide with basic English). The price was WAY less that quoted by the hotels for a private tour.\n\nOn both tours we were met and greeted by someone who immediately directed us what to do and where to go.\n\n*River tour bamboo rafting 1.5 -2 hr, private for 3 people with local guide.\n\nhttps://www.planittripplanner.com/tour/58/private-khao-sok-lake-coral-cave-from-cheow-lan-pier\n\nhttps://www.planittripplanner.com/tour/59/sok-river-tour-by-canoe-or-bamboo-raft-khao-sok-national-park\n\nTips if you book privately:\n\nStart your tours early to miss the crowds and queues. We departed the lake at 8 am and so were ahead of the crowds at Coral Cave and for lunch.\n\nHappy to give more details to anyone interested. Feel free to ask in comments or DM :) Or simply contact the company.",

Anybody had a similar experience and could recommend a solution or a professional that could help?\n\nEdit: the neighbors don\u2019t have problems and the pressure at the meter is good\n\nEdit 2: the filters and taps have been inspected and cleaned already, that\u2019s not it",

There was talk once about importing water to Phuket from Phang-Nga province. Indeed, there will be water shortage in Phuket unless it starts raining soon. Luckily, rainy season is around the corner, hopefully providing enough rain to fill the reservoirs before next dry season. Water will be a problem for Phuket in the future.",

It would be such a great time saver if the delivery option works as described without any annoyance or drama. Does anyone use Makro delivery?

Not least the influx of Russians since the war started, tourist levels running high, massive new building projects, extra water parks sucking water from the water table (many wells in Rawai area are the lowest they have been for years)Phuket hasn\u2019t been this busy with humans for a LONG time - the sheer number of daily showers used, toilets flushed will almost certainly guarantee it will happen within the next 2 months somewhere here. Most of all though the issue is that this is nothing new, and they discuss it every year (apart from Covid years) but have done nothing to expand or add new catchments, dams or run-off collection. Still - got to love Phuket !",

Shopping for a family means alot of food and it ends up being at least a half day worth of hassle just to go grocery shopping. Also the place can at times be full to the brim of people who dont know how to shop in a civilized manner and act like savages LOL.  It ends up just being a time consuming chore. It would be such a great time saver if the delivery option works as described without any annoyance or drama. Does anyone use Makro delivery? Maybe a restaurant owner or something that can share their experience? I would be ordering mostly bulk items and frozen goods. Appreciate any feedback from people who used it!",

Can do through banks? \n\nRight now I have some positions in US and Europe and I want to do it with the thai market locally. \nI know how to google so if you just google now and want to be a smart-ass,  it won't help so save your time. I ask because I have  Googled on the subject and there are pretty many so maybe some of you wonderful people are actually doing it that can shred some light. :)\n\nOh.. I'm married and been here pretty long time so even if you have any thoughts about that such as \" can not on tourist visa etc\", save your breath :)",

They are good in englisch and contact your branch and tell them what they need to do and tell you what you will need.Also when you make a small error, you get a few minutes later a call with a experienced staff. At the website they have a lot of information in english available. Very professional.The main platform is from SET, so there will be not so many differences between the brokers I guess.https://www.bualuang.co.th/?lg=en",

Yes, crowded in the dry season, but that is the price to pay for having this exceptional combination of good things in one place. Still working on improving my Thai language skills. From having lived in Indonesia with the easy-to-learn Bahasa I know that speaking the local language can make you enjoy your experience even more.

The traditional thawb is white though... but arabic women have black dresses similar to thawb.However. This is taking the discussion to another direction.

I lived here before covid for 6 to 7 years on the embassy tourist visa. But I would put two or three weeks between every trip.  in Jakarta thai embassy and similar ones, but you can totally do some Visa exemption in between. There's nothing illegal about it.  My only recommendation is don't do same day Visa runs to neighboring countries. If you do the embassy TR visas, do it a country or two away.  Every two or three years I would just get a new passport. Again you're not breaking any laws but you're just avoiding having uncomfortable discussions with immigration officers at airports. Land borders are always much easier. You could fly here for 2 months and then fly up to udon thani. Walk across the border have a nice week vacation in Laos, get a 2 month Visa extended it to three.   I just renewed my passport a year ago in Hanoi at the US embassy, took 7 days when everybody in the United States was on this weird 6 to 8 week thing which I think they still are.",
                            "one time I got pulled into the little room because I met some Australians on the plane who were super drunk and they were making tons of noise and the immigration officer thought I was one of them because they were talking to me. But when I went inside the office I just politely told them look at my passport, I said I have proper visas with two or three week breaks in between. I didn't have any same day Visa runs in that passport.   And they let me in. And this is when they were really cracking down on this but right now it seems very relaxed since the reopening",

Just stating this as it may affect your visa renewal. \nI went to Phuket immigration to renew my yearly retired visa. \nFor the past years I\u2019ve been using to show monthly income instead of having 800 K baht in the bank. Doing so, I was receiving a letter from the Embassy in Bangkok providing confirmation of my monthly income. NEVER had a problem before with that letter. Today, they did not accept it because of the last paragraph stating:\n\u201cIn providing this letter, the Government of Canada accepts no responsibility or liability for the actions of the above named individual, whom it does not sponsor in any way.\u201d\nNot sure what I am going to do now but I will figure something out. \nGood luck to those that have that letter. \nI am told that the reason of this paragraph being added has to do with the new Consul. \nGo figure why \ud83d\ude24\n\nP.S.\n\nHere\u2019s an update on my post. Returned to the Immigration and had another go at this with copies of the bank documents I had given the embassy to get my letter. \nIt was obvious that what they were concerned with, was the last paragraph on the letter from the embassy. \nAfter spending time 40 mins or so, they decided to accept my renewal this year. \nHowever, they told me that next year if I get the same letter from the embassy, I would be refused. I have contacted the embassy and spoke with the consul and advised her of the reluctance from immigration in Phuket in regards to that last paragraph. She advised that she would be looking into that matter a bit further. I will let you know what comes from this if there\u2019s any changes.",

Thanks to a kind passer by and the persistence of The Bodhi Dog Rescue and Shelter in Paklok they secured his release and now lives at the shelter. Hes put on weight and after regular exercise his legs etc all work fine. \n\nHes young, maybe 18 months, hes fit, healthy and loves people as you can see. \n\nHis life at the shelter is much improved but he would love his own family and he deserves it.\n\nObviously Huskies need a good daily walk and a safe garden space. Ideally for an active family or individual.\n\nWould anyone like to give him a home ?\n\nYou can meet him at The Bodhi Shelter or contact Tina Maria who runs the shelter.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/r/rWEeciLFH7Zi8B6D/\n\nHes ready to go !",

Do I need to do all the steps anyone would do to get the motorbike license?  Or since I have the car license, is it a bit different?  \n\nI see there are driving schools too.  Can I do everything there instead of at the government office?  Pros/cons?  When I got my car license in Chiang Mai, I did everything at the government office, so I'm not sure how the schools work.  If it costs a bit more, but saves time/hassle, I'd be interested.\n\nThanks for any advice.  I know there are a million videos and blogs about this, but they are focused on getting your first license, not my situation.",

Good restaurants right around there. Everything is more walking distance from their hotel. My wife and I go over for a few days while they are here and hangout on the beach there. Probably less crowded than Nai Harn that's right down the street from my house. Rawai is overcrowded these days. I live in a quiet neighborhood and don't want to go out in the traffic all that much. Great bunch of motorcycle riders around here. I see a lot of accidents involving Russians and Thai automobiles and minibuses. I guess if you get a hotel right on Nai Harn, there are some restaurants there, but not the selection of restaurants that Kata has within walking distance. My 2\u00a2...",

All three places have a nicer beach than Patong Beach. All three are less than 15 minutes away from Patong by Bolt or taxi. There are many beautiful towns farther away from Patong, north and south, and you should visit them this trip to see if you want to stay in one of them the next trip.",

There are a good few in Hong Kong who are completely up to date) . You can use a solicitor in the UK remotely through video calls and audio calls, but choose a practice that is responsive and doesn't use a difficult appointments system so you can actually get access to the lawyer helping you (many high street practices were notoriously difficult to communicate with when I was there).",

                            "Agree with Mervyn, this is very bad for a 20k I pay 25k in middle of Phuket (use to be 19k during covid) and its way better than this. I don't know about the sqm of the house but I live in a house project, with communal pool, gym etc, family friendly all around 115sqm livable space 2 floors 2 bathrooms, my office, master bedroom and a guestroom, back kitchen etc.., its not just about the size but also what do you have in it, everything is well taken care of here, I would not plomp 20k down on the house in the picture the furniture is ancient and its completely bare, feels like \"half ass on the go, living out of a suitcase stopping there for a 1 month\" kind of feeling.Just my two cents, but in no way am I trying to come off as negative.. ps, I am about 5-10min from phuket town..I can see it's bigger than what I am in, each room seems big or the camera picture is 0.6x fish eye lense type thing, makes things a bit bigger, but even so, limescale everywhere, and run down around, this could be one beautiful home though if some efforts was put into making it look that way",
                            "Not everyone understands the Minimal industrial look. For those that do, it's a decent house for the money. Some of us live in the Phuket of 5 years ago when something similar in structure but not design would cost about 12,000 baht. Rents now are truly staggering compared to where it used to be. Good luck renting it."

Its key principle is to store sufficient water in three main areas in a balanced ecosystem that distributes moisture naturally throughout the plot while optimizing landscaping and water conservation, and therefore reducing water costs.

I currently know all about it. I couldn't extend my non O based on marriage this year since they now make us register our marriage with the local ampur. To do that the marriage certificate has to be approved by the Thai Foreign Ministry. The Foreign requires the marriage certificate to be certified by my government. The US is very hard to get certified documents from, so I will have to do it in the US and the Thai Embassy for next year. This year I had to go to KL to get off my non \"O,\" come back on 30 days. Go to Phuket Immigration have over \u0e3f800k in the bank the same day you apply that must remain above that balance for two months and not go below \u0e3f500K, then has to be back up to over \u0e3f800K two months before you apply for next year's extension. It all used to be easy! Now it's ridiculous! Two and a half hours at Bangkok Bank in Chalong and then another 2.5 hours at immigration, having to get my landlord out there and finally got it turned in. My paperwork was together but my landlord's had a couple of issues he had to fix."

The problem was in the past it was very easy , all you had to do was go to any Thai bank with your passport and they would open an account for you and you could walk out 20 minutes later with a bank account and an ATM if you wanted one .What happened over past several years was so many tourists were opening bank accounts to avoid paying ATM fees , then withdrawing the balance at the airport and abandoning  the account.  The banks were left with around 2.6 million dormant bank accounts and so over the past 2 years the banks have now stopped allowing people on a tourist visa to open a bank account.  It  seemed to get a lot stricter over the past year with only Bangkok bank allowing it as long as you bought there insurance but  i have learnt from the Patong branch 6 months ago that this is now impossible. For example now , its a catch two situation for someone arriving on a tourist visa then trying to open a bank account to deposit 800,000 to obtain a Non Immigrant O based on retirement.",

They don't have the huge range of \"regular\" bees.Probably not inside your apartment if you only encounter like half a dozen of them. They don't really like cold either so I doubt they'd build inside if you have AC running (the cold is also probably why they seem sleepy).Most likely culprits are any old tree near or under your balcony or old outdoor garbage bins. They CAN build into wall and balcony crevices but they really prefer old half rotten wood and such.They're usually not too aggressive though unless they for whatever reason think you're threatening them or their nest.

Luckily she had some cash on her The chances of being checked are very slim and he saw it whilst she was getting her driving licence out on a traffic stop.

But we looked back at our security camera and found that he was hanging around since midnight. Grabbing drinks, walking around the area and then later going into our reception area looking for cash and tried to get into our tip box. He tried to go into our house!! He later left around 5am and then came back again where we found him.\n\nWe already went to the police and thankfully my family is safe.\n\nJust wanted to warn anyone who has accommodation business that there is a potential thief in the area and a squatter.",

(Everything is locked away now..)\n\nIf you spot some youngster in the neighbourhood riding a newly acquired green and black Fortem bike, please could you drop me a message? I will be discreet about any info I get, thanks.",

I mean in many places in the world if one has a sign saying open 9-5 then one could be positive those are indeed opening and closing times as in many cultures that is very important. Here it can mean nothing even for quite big businesses. I smile (usually) when people refer to the clock here as \u2018Thai time.\u2019But I would be a liar even after 16 or so years of living here that it has not sometimes frustrated me. To turn up and a place of business should be absolutely open but it\u2019s closed. Etc etc I love relaxed approach but I also believe heavily in being punctual. To many living here that won\u2019t matter. And perhaps they are right."

If I were you I would definetely look into the Thai elite options, they have just been revised but for someone like you it should still be attractive, with 46 you can do the 5 year option and after that just apply for retirement visa. Advantage, you\u2019ll be all set with bank account and all when time comes for the retirement visa, it will be a walk in the park coming from TE. Disadvantage, its a bit pricey.  My advice, stay far away from ED and volunteer visa\u2019s. A lot burned their fingers on them later where they got denied extensions or re-entry.",

We have a golden retriever. It is a very trained and clean dog. Because he has received special training, he does not bark and only goes to the toilet outside. We came for our honeymoon and brought him from Turkey because he was a very well-behaved dog. We can provide a deposit for the items. We would be very happy if you could help us with the house.",

Shoulder yrs? You are talking rotator cuff tendinitis, bursitis, supraspinatus tendinitis (a variation of rot. cuff), adhesive capsulitis, potential labrum tears, and throw in if years possible osteophytes (calcium spurs) read degenerative arthritis to hoot. And factor in if not treated correctly with inappropriate massage techniques they can make many of the above much worse. Just a thought Gary sorry. Yes I am a therapist: Chiropractor, Osteopath Naturopath and also use dry needling acupuncture. Good luck Dr Ray",

It\u2019s gotten better but I still have regular numbness in ky arm down to my hand. I injured my rotator cuff playing basketball and separated it in a dirt bike accident years ago. It\u2019s mostly healed but I think there\u2019s a lot of scar tissue. I also used to be an endurance athlete and did 200-300 pushups for years. There\u2019s a lump in my upper scapular area and a few other painful spots around my shoulder have developed over the years. I found an excellent remedial massage therapist in Pattaya who worked in a hospital. She also did the best adjustments I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019d never felt better and also found her via FB recommendation. I had some dry needling last week in Koh Samui. I\u2019d like to check out your practice while I\u2019m here.",

It collects in the grout lanes. \nIt's very easy to brush off and then lays at the bottom where I can vacuum it up. But it is annoying and I've never had it before.\nAny thoughts on what might be causing it?",

I climbed our wall today and found this male dog with bamboo vines wrapped around the neck and submerged in water, innthe waist deep river that runs alongside. He must have been there for at least two days. Managed to get him out, washed fed and watered. He didn't have a collar and is no spring chicken. We can keep him tonight but have two pit bulls who don't mix with outside dogs. Are there any rescue centres down south that can come and take him ? Super friendly but also super exhausted!",

Phang Nga is a big province. Most of it is farmland and small villages 99.9% occupied by Thai people. The only real tourist area up there is Khao Lak. Most of the people I know who live in Khao Lak run businesses. If you want to immerse yourself into village or city life with your neighbors being Thai, look at Phang Nga Town, Kok Kloi, the waterfall areas around Lampi. There are some nice golf courses in Phang Nga like Katathong. It's countryside, jungle, farmland, temples. If you move there you will have to learn to speak Thai if you don't already. There is no international hospital yet if that is a concern, there are no shopping malls except places like Tesco and they don't carry the range of products Phuket's stores do. The roads are great if you like to drive fast.",

Phuket is crowded, expensive and busy, but also includes great variety in terms of food, cafe's, malls, events, nightlife and people to meet. If you don't need any of that and are looking for a more relaxed environment, then Phang Nga would check most boxes. Personally, since I'm beyond partying/nightlife (which I did enjoy several years ago), I do find Phang Nga living an interesting idea, but I still appreciate the variety to be found across the island of Phuket. Maybe when I get closer to retirement. As stated by others, it depends on where you are at in life and what you are looking for.",

For Express you get support direct from Express. If you don't like to connect the internal accounting with the accounting for the Revenue Department, than look for a remote freelancer to setup it.Another good program is Flowchart, it delivers a good amount of reports including charts. Easy to use, but the most accountants in Phuket don't use it.I use internal Flowchart and my Accountant use Express. My internal accounting is used to check the external and write invoices/ quotations.External I use Tacteam, they are good (the owner is auditor). But work only with Express. I know some companies that use NAT Accounting, they are also happy, they are well known for international standards.",

I am reaching out on behalf of HeadStart International School to invite food vendors to participate in our second annual Aqua Panthers Swim Invitational. The event will take place on November 11th and 12th at our school campus.\n\nWe are expecting a significant turnout, with approximately 250-300 athletes, parents, and coaches attending the event. This means there will be a good amount of foot traffic, providing an excellent opportunity for vendors to showcase their culinary offerings.\n\nThe rate for participating as a food vendor is 350 baht per day. However, we kindly request vendors to commit to both days of the event to ensure a consistent presence throughout. \n\nTo avoid any conflicts with our existing vendors, we kindly ask that you provide us with information about the type of food you sell. This will help us ensure a diverse and complementary range of food options for our attendees.\n\nIf you are interested in joining us as a food vendor for the Aqua Panthers Swim Invitational, please send me a private message. Feel free to include any additional details or questions you may have.\n\nThank you for considering this opportunity, and we look forward to hearing from you soon. Have a fantastic day!",

                            "I only took 2-3 photos that were of my interest in relation to a family memebers stay 2 are above in this post and the 3rd one was of the bathroom. Small review:The entrance had a nice ramp to go up from the front parking lot, but what I loved about this place was simply it was ginormous, the entrance was basically \"outside\" with a round desk in the middle, enough space everywhere, and the handicap rooms were on the ground floor really ease of access through a wide double door, the access to elevator and the yard had a nice walkway that is not \"narrow and precise\" but wide enough you can really enjoy rolling through it on a chair, the B7 floor where the dining area is, again nothing but wide spaces double doors and everything well thought out even the Gym area is wide open space so its easy to roll around and pickup weights, I was in awe.. The only drawback was that for some reason they failed to do a ramp to the swimming pool area, maybe an assumption that people in wheel chairs don't like to go sit in the shallow end and soak in the sun, it's about 4-5 steps up to a fake grass platform towards the pool, If you are with a family member this can be accomplished by simply helping one up stairs but it would be nice if it were cleanly accessible without assistance as sometimes pride can get in the way. With that said, we were really thrilled with the area (for our use as the family member isn't much a swimmer so maybe not a deal breaker for some, I personally myself am not a pool addict and have lived in the past in a condo 2 years entering pool 1, to each their own). it can really allow the induvidual to roam around his wide space room from bed to the toilet, to the chair in the shower, no steps or anything just flat surface nice area for anyone to transition from his chair to his shower chair, reminded you of a hospital WC stall spacious.We will definitely give it a go when the person comes down here",
                            "Regarding the swimming pool lift, unfortunately we checked all around found nothing, asked the desk and it turns out this is the only drawback, they are missing a ramp to this area.. the ONLY area the top roof swimming pool or they would have gotten 10/10 instead of 9/10 in my head. I saw so many nice shallow ends to sit down in and soak in the sun that I figured it would be accessible somewhere on the side but nothing, so no pool lift either since this area lacks. Again takes 1-2 points off in my book but the friendlyness and everything else being very accessible you could play basketball in the lobby with chairs, I gave it a thumbs up for the member.",
                            "Look at the lobby size",
                            "Unfortuantely this is where they missed the mark, access to this area, even shallow ends, anyway It's what we needed and I am glad I got this recommendation because of access we need in Phuket, we live in Phuket but the person coming, we want them to feel welcomed, so we can go about the day and do as little of \"oh we can't go here, they don't accommodate wheelchair people\" it's very big of a mood killer on a good day out ..

These transformers are very expensive to buy and also expensive to maintain as like ours they blow up quite often. The extra cost your being charged per unit goes towards maintaining the transformer and other associated infrastructure with a common electricity supply. In a case like this you can not arrange your own electricity supply directly with the PEA. If that rate of 7 thb per unit as been voted on and agreed at the AGM there is nothing you can do about it except pay. If you dont pay the juristic body will legally disconnect your electricity supply.",

This rule apparently applies to all of Southern Thailand provinces. To obtain this visa, one must get a new passport entirely.\n\nI've contacted a few schools and one mentioned getting a 12 month university education visa that actually includes a 90 day stamp (15 months total) but all of the paperwork would require a trip to Chiang Mai. Classes are done on Zoom. It's significantly more expensive and I'm a little concerned about the legitimacy of this visa as it ALSO requires a new passport after using it. \n\nHas anyone else run into this issue? Has anyone studied at a school elsewhere in Thailand and participated in online classes? Looking forward to your responses. Thank you!",

A recent poster to this forum said, \"there is a massive real estate scam in Phuket / Patong at the moment.\"  It's that \"at the moment\" that really caught my eye.  There is an absolutely marvelous book called \"Siam Was Our Home,\" by Edna Brunner Bulkley.  She, with her doctor husband, established the first Western hospital in South Thailand in 1904.  She bore and raised six children there, and today there are still a number of Thai citizens named \"Bulkley.\"  One was a granddaughter, who posted in 2004 that she had been selling real estate on Koh Samui but she was quitting because of all the chicanery, thievery, and dishonesty in the island's real estate industry.  So here's a woman with literally a century of Thai history behind her, a Thai citizen fluent in Thai with all the legal rights of a Thai citizen, but she's quitting her job because of the dishonesty she encounters every day.  I don't know why any farang coming to Phuket would think it would be any different there.  Come on, people.  You see all those condos on the hillsides?  They were all built with money scammed from people just like you.  Just like Vegas was built on the backs of the losers, so too any island's real estate industry.  Don't act surprised when the scorpion stings you on the far side of the river.  You knew what he was when you invited him to climb on your back.",

That is something that takes maybe 15-25 minutes.This they need to repair the wall, perhaps dig deeper to resolve the water damage inside, they need to also come inside (at least here to repair the ceiling), this is going to cost much more than that.. longer hours, much more work.. I can't tell you honestly the price but I would just remove the 2000 baht out of the question and just get a quote  that way you will get PM/Line messages from people willing to do the work if you can come to an agreement of a price.. Don't mention a ceiling to your price, just PM and see if you can find someone willing to do the work and for how much.Good luck",

It's not exceeding 10.000 baht probably she said fixing outside and the ceiling inside, but she also uses them often and recommends them and has a good deal with them.. So yeah the way she speaks indicates this kind of work runs you 10k or there about.. closer to 10k than 2k"

For seriouse health issues are really the Massage Shops at the Government Hospitals and Health Centers better. They have normal studied between 400 - 800h medical Massage at the University. This is pretty close to physio Therapists. But the price is complete different, because it costs around the same like a normal massage. But it can be painful and the funny part it's that the issue is sometimes not immediatly gone, but at the next day."

Get the employer to supply you with half a ton of paperwork to support your work permit application.3. Apply for work permit.You can't get a work permit and then look for a job. Only the other way around.Alternatively, you could set up your own company or partnership - it's not too difficult - but you'll need at least one Thai partner. Your wife? She'll need to be the senior partner so she can employ you.And you'll need to pay an accountant to keep the books in order and work out how much tax you personally and your company will have to pay.Your work permit will specify very precisely what your job is and the name of the company you work for.You may not do any other work or work for anyone else.The fact that you are asking this question suggests you want to work legally.I speak from experience. It's complex but doable without any input from a lawyer. You'll just spend many hours in govt offices. You will never have all the right documents first time round.But one thing you will NOT need is a lawyer. Just a good accountant.",

Ideally id like to print all the needed documents for the agent and have them pick everything up from my house and do all the legwork at immigration and just call me and tell me when to be at immigration so that it doesnt take up so much of my time, and I can avoid all the run-around. If anyone does this, can you share how much you pay for the service, and what exactly they require of you? Maybe you can send me your agent details? Time is money and immigration is a huge hassle especially trying to haul my kids around with me.",

Since I've relocated to Thailand, I'm in search of comprehensive health insurance to cover all my medical expenses, given that I no longer have medical coverage in my home country. I'm wondering if any of you know of a local insurance agent in Phuket, or perhaps an international one, who could assist me in purchasing the right insurance here in Thailand. If you have had a positive experience with an agent, I would greatly appreciate any recommendations you could provide.\n\nThank you in advance.",

I believe you can stay in some of the islands in the similans - I would do that at some point in the trip for 2.3 nights. Next best would be racha island. Other than that maybe hotels in kata ?  might be able to help - that's more his neck of the woods. If you want a really good snorkeling experience ask him about paying for his GF Kik to take you and guide you. She great at finding interesting stuff.",

Two airlines told me no ( can't remember which ones) but Nok Air said I could so I ended up booking with them for peace of mind and I had no problem at all flying just with my ID. Def share an update once you confirm with AirAsia as it if they let you.   Good luck!",

But since the night of the 28th of July, at 10:00pm, the kitty has not returned home. \n\nIf anyone have seen him or is taking care of him now, please be humble and return the little kitty to its family.

With no owner the title cannot be transferred or altered. As an agent we\u2019ve been involved in this kind of thing before, usually because the company fails to provide an audit for three years  and is shut down by the business department. The only way to reopen the company is with a court order, a process which usually takes around one year. I am not sure it is possible to voluntarily close a company that has assets, and even it were I cannot imagine a reason why anyone would want to do this without first selling on the assets. If the title with the lease is sold this has no impact on your rights and the new owner is bound by the same terms as the previous. The lease is tied to the title and not the owner.",

I don't think there are better deals for 45$ as I know.. \n\n2- flying with the following bag (end of post) I am obliged to buy a luggage storage or I can use it as personal baggage (free)?\nI remained with my knowledge to my last travel about 6 years ago and rules probably were less strict.. \nIf I must buy the baggage, how to find tickets with baggage included in the price?\n\n3- If last question isn't enough, which is the best website that can let you find best compromise between flight length, baggage and low price and easily find the cheapest flight from north of Italy to Phuket??\nI tried both incognito mode and kiwi.com (cheapest site that I know) and Skyscanner for September but still I can't find nothing less than 400\u20ac (leaving from Bologna one way). I m open to move any day from August to beginning of November. \n\n4- what else should you suggest me, apart from checking visa layover fees (I already had troubles), Booking.com (is it still the best app for best prices?) for sleeping on the layover country (if needed), checking and getting luggage between flights (if needed), buying a sim at the airport?\n\n5-any other useful app for Phuket (ex. restaurants, tuktuks /taxi, etc)?\nI already have been twice in Thailand, never in Phuket, so I want to be organized at the best way.\n\nThank you sooooo much for all your precious help!\n\nBag:\nhttps://www.bargainbaitbox.com/products/locallion-40l-big-load-knapsack-women-men-outdoor-sports-bags-military-camouflage-backpacks-for-climbing-hiking-fishing-xa215wd?variant=61483789323",

It was never an issue when I forgot for a while, they covered me. But when I bought a new car from a 2nd hand dealer, the staff there does the shopping for me and presents me with several options each March. In general my wife is very good about shopping around for insurance, she has insurance up the yin-yang, i.e. insurance for everything. But for my car she couldn't find a better deal than my car dealer did. I pay less than RooJai. How much and what it entails can really depend on the type of car you have too, and of course, how old it is.",

They have nearly all insurance companies, even the insurance that I had, remind me on time, make the tax and informed me about the different kind of contracts. But she speaks only Thai, what is fine for me. It's all about the agent. Funny to pay the premium to Toyota for a MG. And I pay a bit more for a contract where I can go to the dealer. And when I needed them, they worked perfect for me.",

                            "Yes, speaking Thai (and now reading and writing which you'll recall I learned during Covid) makes a huge difference. None of the staff at my car dealership speak English except the owner. We communicate by Line App and phone and in person, it all works very well. I'm super happy with House of Cars in Thalang. I am treated like a king there. But yes, I have heard that Pearl does that. They are a huge business now, and these kinds of services are well needed in Phuket, and inevitable with the economic success that people have had here. How do you like your MG? There sure are a lot of them on the road these days, it's like every other car I see these days, when it used to be Hondas and Toyotas.",
                            "I love my MG, the dealer where I bought it (at this time the only one) is rubbish. But MG pushed the Thai market, since the main production is in Thailand. The dealer at Bypass is great.And a good service keeps customers. I am sure there are more good insurance agents out. And some are just to stupid to make a business. A good schedule and message a customer on time is the easiest way to sell insurance and make the customer happy.At House of Cars work a friend, they are for a good reason the biggest 2nd car dealer here.And language makes always a big difference. The costs for lessons paid so many times out."

I read online that Malaysian cars/vehicles  can come for UP to 6 months. But general consensus and understanding is you are given 30 days at the border. How does one make 30 days become 6 months? \n \n\n2. If indeed 6 months is possible, can i then send the vehicle  back at the 6 month period and come back the next day for a further 6 months? (i read on other threads that immediate exit and reentry is common and wont pose an issue, although that was usually against 30 day permits)\n \n\n3. In the event of an overstay, how much is the fine and how is it computed? Does the government have the right to confiscate the vehicle? \n \n\n4. Does the severity of the overstay relate to the length of the overstay logically? Ie : Overstay by 2 months, pay a fine. Overstay by 12 months, lose your vehicle. \n\n \nThanks in advance .",

He looks like a German Shephard but is about half the size (15kg).\n\nHe is very calm and loves to snooze. Hes great with people and children. Hes not great with cats but has lived very happily with other similar sized dogs in a family home (foster home and trial adoption) and is mostly the submissive one.\n\nThe only issue is he needs a firm hand on his walks as he interacts firmly with other dogs who get close when he is on a lead. He is not a big dog but you still need to be firm and fit !. I think he craves his freedom so perhaps walks in safe areas where he can have time off the lead would be good.\n\nDont be put off, he is an incredibly beautiful and gentle boy and would be great people/families who are fit and active.\n\nHes based in Rawai and you can meet him anytime x",

However, she is also pretty independent and happily plays on her own so would do well as a solo pet too.\n\nShe has been dewormed, deflead, and has had her first vaccination \ud83d\udc89\n\nIf your home is in need of some extra kitten love, please reach out to me via PM",

                "comment": "Hi again Gemma, How is she going since 2June'23...... Maybe you were busy so did not update me. I said, I'm very willing, eagar and able to take her at mine, towards end of this month..... Absolutely no problem, provided of course she's stable, healthy and gaining weight, with vet book and copies of history and lab work so far. Everything being prepared to have her. 3 things, which I did not get the chance to tell you on our vid-call 2June :1- I delayed taking her, on about 1mth, as she was very fragile, and only out of hospital, 1 day post Parvo, at 7weeks well within the \"failing kitty\" period, especially considering her rough history. I've raised a few mini babas, with dropper/syringe/bottle for 10-12 weeks each, so know the deal. I've resuscitated kitties 3 times. 2- she received the next day, 3June, her vaccination, which does weaken the immune system initially, especially the multivalent Fellocell, which does contain min 3-5 different \"diseases\", same dose regardless if 600gm weight or 6kg...... So I considered it prudent to keep kitty close to vet who knows her already, your vet, also close to 24/7 help, and 3-: I also know well not to stress her out, (any cat/dog) even more all in one go, by changing human, house, environment, food, while dealing with recovery of living rough ordeal, of Parvo, parasite worm infestation, diarrhea/dehydration, + that vaccine while so very small. Her little body is trying now to detox all the medications and up-heaval Seven has required since 20May.                                              As I told you, I'd already organised a major house and surroundings \"clean up\" for June, lots of work, now full in swing.... In 2 weeks, if her immune system becomes and stays strong, kitty will have dealt with all the issues from late May early June, gained weight, be worm free, with no ill effects of that 1st vax. These are my reasons for delaying her adoption (per 2June) on max 4 weeks, now another 2weeks. These are very well medically considered, and personal reasons for delaying taking Seven kitty to my place.                    I've had the experience of nursing back to health, alone during the last 2 years, 3 dogs and 4 cats, all who became extremely sick, \"immune deficiency syndromes\", then picking up every disease/cancer around, due to living rough then massive medical intervention, and the meds/de-worm/anti tick/vax etc which over-loaded the already fragile natural immune system/liver/kidneys.....took months and months to heal those animals....... I do (sadly) know alot about this new disease process, humans but especially in our beloved cats/dogs.                                                  I year ago I cared for almost 100 animals alone daily, so the few I have now is easy........ no kids, no partner as distraction. Some may question behind my back my age........ age is a number and by no means represents HEALTH, energy, conviction, dedication. I challenge any to do a Pilates round with me, or hot foot it up and down then back up my 1st gear mountain top jungle track......I regularly donate blood....... just saying...... I've never in my life felt stronger and healthier........                                          Anyway, I've been awaiting any update post 1st vax, and general update, hopefully strengthening of baby Seven. Please advise, and rest assured, I'm committed to taking her, which I considered well for 14 days, before messaging/then calling you 2June.",

She will happily play with her toys alone but as soon as you pick her up, she will be purring loudly in your arms and staring deeply into your eyes.\n\nFrom getting rescued from a car engine to defeating a deadly disease, Seven has definitely had an eventful start to life.\n\nShe has had luck on her side up until now, but is now in need of some more to find her purrfect forever home \ud83e\udd1e\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a lucky charm, a cuddly companion, and a kitty with one hell of a fighting spirit, Seven is your girl! \n\nShe has been dewormed, deflead, and will be getting her first vaccination tomorrow \ud83d\udc89\n\nPlease DM me if you are interested in adopting her \ud83d\ude4f",

She\u2019s wondering about the legality of her rental contract and if she has any recourse she can take that\u2019s not \u201cmove out and find another place\u201d. She has never spoken to or met the owner of her condo. The contract was drafted by our condo management company (one of the big ones here) and she also pays rent to their account. The signature on the contract is the signature of the owner (allegedly), who is Japanese based on his name, but she has no other information about him apart from that, and has no way to contact him directly. The contract only includes a photo of her passport, but not the owner\u2019s. When she asks the management company to have a copy of the owner\u2019s passport, they refuse to give it to her, citing data privacy and that they never ever share owner details with tenants.\nCan she legally demand the owner information from the management company? And the owner\u2019s contact details so she can speak with him directly? She\u2019s frustrated because the condo has not been maintained for years, and the owner is not responding to any requests for repairs or replacements (big things, not small things she can do herself) that the management company forwards to the owner. They claim they asked the owner 6 months ago, without a reply, but don\u2019t seem bothered enough to push the owner. At this stage, it\u2019s not even clear that the owner is who they say he is, as they refuse to give her any information than a name written on a piece of paper.\nI have rented 3 times in Thailand and all 3 contracts have included the passport of the tenant and the landlord/owner and contact details of the owner, and we have been indirect contact with them about everything, so based on my experience this doesn\u2019t seem right at all.\nShe doesn\u2019t want to leave, because the price is good and the place is close to her office. And it\u2019s not easy to find reasonably priced rentals in Phuket right now.",

Contracts over 3 years must be there also registered.If the owner is a company, you can get from the DBD the registration with the managing director and a shareholder list.The problem is, all this hassle don't fix her anything. She could now make a civil court case what takes years and costs at first money for the Lawyer.Especially after it's pretty clear that the owner and the management company don't care and maybe they would be happy if the contract ends, because the rental is reasonable.Practical means this she can think if the rental is that cheap that she better let it fix on her own costs, or live with this or search for another place.

I had my rental contract end 7 months early, I talked to a lawyer about it and she just said you're just lucky to get your full deposit back. This isn't back home, nothing worthwhile you can do, if she needs something fixed she should do the math on cost of moving to another area or paying to fix it herself if owner doesn't want to fix it. However if she lets say takes it out of the months rental price the owner can hire some goons to kick her out of the place if they get pissed off. IMO buying property here is a bad idea, condos even though the owners pay a yearly fee to management tend to age quick and maintenance seriously lacks, after 5 years condo complexes don't look nice and after 10 they usually look like shit. But at least you won't have to deal with a shitty landlord again. You really have no real power here, I rented a condo once and they billed me 17,000 for cleaning fee .",

Tar balls that appear on central California shores during the winter months often originate from southern California seeps on the seafloor.\n\nWhen crude oil (or a heavier refined product) floats on the ocean surface, its physical characteristics change. During the first few hours of a spill, the oil spreads into a thin slick. Winds and waves tear the slick into smaller patches that are scattered over a much wider area. Various physical, chemical, and biological processes change the appearance of the oil. These processes are generally called \"[weathering](https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/oil-and-chemical-spills/significant-incidents/exxon-valdez-oil-spill/what-weathering.html).\"\n\nInitially, the lighter components of the oil evaporate much like a small gasoline or diesel spill. In the cases of heavier types of oil, such as crude oil or home heating oil, much of the oil remains behind. At the same time, some crude oils mix with water to form an emulsion that often looks like chocolate pudding. This emulsion is much thicker and stickier than the original oil. Winds and waves continue to stretch and tear the oil patches into smaller pieces, or tar balls. While some tar balls may be as large as pancakes, most are coin-sized. Tar balls are very persistent in the marine environment and can travel hundreds of miles.",

A new small venture offering the service we all would love to have!\n\nSo I booked Dominic, and he came round for a quote and returned the next day on time to start the big job of cleaning the rear walls and floor of my rental garden. Dominic takes care to discuss with you all your requirements and completes the task as requested.\n\nIn blistering sun(morning) and hotter temps than any of us would like he and Shampu did a fantastic job. All I can say is if your looking for a reliable/punctual/affordable power jet cleaning service, Dominic is the one I would definitely recommend.\n\nAnd from every job he completes and is paid for a % donation will go to a local cat charity (RAL rescue in Rawai).\n\nI have posted the photos below of before and after and a short video to show how thorough the cleaning process is, even though you think they are clean (the walls and floors) They are not lol\n\nGive Dominic a call/message today! and not only help a new small business but all your furry friends on the streets!\n\nThank you, Dominic, and Shampu!",

It's nice to see people getting us together, arranging meet-ups and organizing events again. But it gets a bit much when you get 200+ people in a single WhatsApp group. 3 people talk about something random, and it pings the entire group. Like most people, I end up muting these groups, and when I go back to check, I have to scroll down what feels like 17km of chat to see if I missed anything.\n\nThere is a solution I would like us all to try, though, and that is Discord. It's an app similar to FB Messager and WhatsApp, but instead of a singular channel, it's a multi-channel platform with many channels based around different subjects. These channels are also based on the interests you select, so you will only see the channel if you are not interested in that subject. @everyone\n## **Click here to join the PHUKET Discord: [https://www.discord.gg/BxAFRBc](https://www.discord.gg/BxAFRBc?fbclid=IwAR02P1spP9zAMn0s1pzwWmcG0VnqOx1zXI_3v8R7C0WIjQaX5Urt8cfIulc)**\n\nI also added an AI bot to Discord called \"Pad Thai\". \ud83d\ude02 It can answer questions people might have and a ticket support system. I would like to see how it evolves. I will also be arranging some meet-ups there, so let me know if you have any suggestions.",

Our flights to and from Thailand are booked, but we're keeping our in-country itinerary flexible.    Here's our tentative plan, and I'd appreciate any advice or suggestions:\n* **Bangkok (3 Nights)**: We'll be staying in the Sukhumvit area. Any family-friendly activities or specific spots in Sukhumvit you'd recommend for a family with a kid?\n* **Hua Hin (3-4 Nights)**: Drawn to its expat community but mindful of the air quality in March. Any alternative activity suggestions or local advice?\n* **Phuket (8 Nights)**: Seeking a calm area suitable for families and conducive to remote work, away from the Patong area. Which places would you recommend?\n* **Krabi (8 Nights)**: Looking for recommendations on peaceful, family-friendly places to stay.\n* **Back to Bangkok (1 Night)**: Before the flight.\n\nWe're saving Northern Thailand for a later visit. What would you add or change in our itinerary?\n\nThanks a lot for your help!",

At Eve we short lease (=long term rent/ minimum one month) electric motorbikes and electric cars. Eve stands for EV (electric vehicle) but also refers to Eve from the Garden of Eden; by promoting and enabling people to drive electric, we want to support preserving Phuket as a paradise for generations to come.\n\nOn June 20 our first two electric cars will arrive. We chose the Tesla model 3, because of its proven technology and Tesla's focus on safety. As an introduction offer, we are offering the Tesla's for 30.000 thb/ month. This offer is valid until August. If you are interested, please DM me.\n\nPlease check out [ev-eve.com](http://ev-eve.com/?fbclid=IwAR3GjOMjKqMtJAjdOSNii98TzH4Mn8uMwflWiJm0FR1EtaEUhTPH_X8kIYA) to learn more about our offering.\n\nHave a great weekend!

        "post_text": "Dear Phuket expats,\n\nFirst of all, forgive me for this lengthy post. A request for your valuable input as I embark on an exciting new venture in Phuket. My business, named \"Eve,\" focuses on short-term leasing of electric motorbikes (Niu) and electric cars (Tesla), (short lease = rental for a month or longer).\n\nHaving moved to Phuket two years ago, I am deeply passionate about making a positive impact on the environment and our community by promoting electric vehicles (EVs). I understand that EVs are still relatively expensive for many local residents, which is why I have initially targeted expats as our primary customer base. However, my long-term vision includes encouraging locals, especially motorbike users, to transition to EVs.\n\nMany of you have deep roots in Phuket, and I value your opinions immensely. Specifically, I would appreciate your insights on the following:\n\n**Electric Motorbikes:** Electric cars from brands like BYD, MG, Haval, and Tesla are gaining popularity on Phuket's roads, yet electric motorbikes, despite their easy charging and cost-effective fuel savings, remain rare, even among expats and tourists. Why do you think electric motorbikes are adopted more slowly than cars, and what can be done to encourage their use?\n\n**Reaching New Families:** We aim to connect with individuals and families either before or shortly after their arrival in Phuket. However, over time, priorities change, leading them to rent vehicles from other sources. While we engage with real estate brokers and participate in expat communities on social media, can you recommend alternative ways to reach relocating families in Phuket?\n\nI understand that there may be skepticism surrounding EVs, and I welcome your candid opinions as they help me to improve my concept.\n\nThank you in advance for taking the time to share your insights.\n\nWarm regards, Nick\n\nPS: If you want to get a better sense of what we do, then take a look at www.ev-eve.com",

                            "I'll tell you why expats aren't switching to EV motorbikes. It's cost. Several years ago in Phuket I bought a used Honda  motorcycle for 5,000 baht. It worked perfectly and I used it almost every day for 3 years without any problems whatsoever and then I sold it for 6,000 baht. Best transportation deal ever. There is a plentiful and cheap supply of used motorbikes and it's also quite cheap to rent. The cost of a decent EV bike can't compete with that. Since leaving Phuket I'm currently living in a small rural village in Isaan and I was surprised to notice a lot of the local Thais riding cheap electric bikes that you can order from Lazada for 15,000 baht. Nothing to get very excited about, but you can get something quite reasonable for 30,000 baht as a local runaround bike. But if you were to compare the price of an EV that had the same kind of quality as a 50,000 baht Honda Wave you would be looking at around 150,000 Baht for the equivalent EV bike. I think it's a difficult market to break into. I'm sure it will get going eventually as long as we avoid the cheap bikes with batteries that are continually catching fire in China. I say this is an EV enthusiast who is considering buying an EV car."

If you have a power cut in your area you can still ride your scooter to a Petrol station nearby and fill it up - or use a local \u201cwhisky bottle\u201d Petrol shop. Plus how many condos / rooms have bike charging facilities? Probably none. Compare that to a cheap honda click which will last for years, can be bought for a few thousand per month and sips cheap petrol.Why on earth would you want the inconvenience of an electric bike?",
                            "Valid points once again, Matthew. However, I have a few counterarguments: I live in Laguna, where we hardly experience any blackouts. Before I go to bed, I habitually charge my phone, toothbrush, and bike.Furthermore, there's a strong focus on the environmental aspect, which is commendable. Perhaps I'm growing older, but I'm not a fan of the sound of a combustion bike, let alone the sound of ten of them or a tuned motorbike. Just imagine waiting at a red light without all these sounds around you, and not having to inhale the exhaust gases from the car or bike in front of you...",
                            "with the greatest respect, as an expat living in Laguna you probably have no concept of the average expat or thai living in phuket town / Patong / karon / rawai in a condo with no charging facilities. Power outages are a regular occurrence across the country, especially in the rainy season.You might need to come down from your lofty position and see how the main population live in the island.With no infrastructure, expensive prices, unknown resale value and reliability plus the very questionable way in which the batteries are made - I can\u2019t see any reason to get people off their clicks and onto an electric bike any time soon.Plus of course that the young kids LOVE making as much noise as possible - that\u2019s why so many bikes have straight through pipes on them\u2026.. why would they want to whisper about when their scooters can rattle windows at 100 metres !",
                            "Haha, you're right about the young kids. Of course, they love to make noise. That doesn't necessarily mean that others enjoy it:)And don't worry, I love touring on my bike all over the island, so I've been just about everywhere. In fact, we have quite a few young digital nomads living in the south who lease our bikes. But I'm aware that Laguna is not representative of Phuket",
                            "Is it really that bad in Phuket Town ? I know there are power outages in rainy season but they're usually brief, a few hours at most. I don't see how they would seriously impact charging a bike. You regularly have multi day blackouts there?",
                            "I said \u201chalf a day\u201d which is \u201ca few hours at most\u201d as you say as well.The point being if your bike battery is flat you are stuck.If your petrol bike is out of gas you can go to a whisky bottle shop and buy some.The real issue though is where would you even charge it? If you live in a huge villa in Laguna then that fine but for the thousands of people in condos you have no chance.",
                            "Hi Matthew, you can simply remove the battery from your bike and charge it in your condo. Depending on how often you use your bike and the type of bike, you may need to do this once or twice a week. I always do it at night so that I have a full battery in the morning.",

                            "That is correct, Keith. We lease this bike for THB 8,000 per month. Keep in mind that if someone uses a motorbike like this, they will likely spend between THB 1,500 to THB 2,000 on fuel per month, whereas charging the GTS only costs 13 THB. So, all in all, the monthly lease price of this bike is similar to leasing a Honda ADV 160, for example.",
                            ", so you are comparing one charging of EV to month usage of conventional bike? PCX can be rented for long term around 2000/month, maybe that explains why 8000/month is not so good option for many, as you get smaller bike with much higher cost. If PCX brakes down, there are hundreds of shops in the island to fix it.Also one thing that is bad with EVs, they don't make noise (don't know if that mode has some noise generator for low speeds) and being silent makes you more prone to be run over by some vehicle or run under by some animal. Phuket and Bangkok would be last of the places for me to drive with something that doesn't protect me in case of crash and that is silent.",
                            "Hi Tatu, Most people who are considering riding an electric motorbike compare costs. Therefore, I have shared this cost comparison. The rental price for a Honda PCX for a month or more is approximately THB 9,000 per month. You can find more details here: https://enigmarentals.com/rent-a-honda-adv-160cc/ And you are correct, Niu bike parts usually need to be sourced from Bangkok, which typically takes a few days.",
                            ", 9000/month? That\u2019s crazy high, even for short 2-3 months rentals I have never paid over 4000/month.For cost comparison, my point was, that 14 thb does not equal to the mentioned 1500-2000 thb.",
                            "That is correct Tatu. When you would charge your bike every day, you'd spend 30 * THB 14 = THB 420 vs THB 1500-2000"

Range aside, getting the funding to offer them for rent and finding an insurance provider allowing the same will be the mission.  There is no way to structure this business with teslas in Thailand where money would be made. EV ownership turns into a nightmare when there is lack of charging stations, and service spots. Then you just have a paperweight. Teslas use oil too, for the gear reduction and differential and cooling. They have a filter and everything. If you want to be passionate for the environment plant trees, and restore marine habitats. When people add that they are passionate for EV it usually collides with them saying so just for profit.",

Our Teslas are insured by Virayah, one of Thailand's largest car insurance companies.Additionally, setting up your own charging station at home is quite easy. I've coordinated several installations for customers, and they all went smoothly."

I know that most governments have mandated the halt of production of ICE vehicles within the next 10 year, but the reality is that most countries dont have the capacity to produce enough electricity for us all to be driving EV's and I am not convinced that situation will be vastly different in 10 yeas time. Thats before we even get into the discussion of lithium mining and the slave/chid labour that is used to mine it. Currently, there is  not 1 single lithium battery manufacturer that can guarantee that slave/child labour was not used in the mining of the lithium for it batteries.",
                            "Yes, I understand. But some governments are just itching to mandate us all into driving EVs. In California the State has reportedly mandated only EV purchases by 2035. Yet their electric grid is dirty, unreliable, and causes wild fires. I see the government here is just itching to do the same thing even though it makes little sense. Import taxes on EVs and Hybrids are way lower than on ICUs. You can buy a Tesla here now for 1.7 million baht. Two years ago they were over 4 million if I remember correctly. Thailand's government can do a lot to improve the use of solar at home by offering tax incentives and cheaper imports of materials, but they seem to really love the idea of EVs and I get worried they will be forced on us. For families who have two or more cars, one small EV to get around town, an electric shopping car, especially here in Phuket, is a nice way to go for sure, especially if you can charge it at home (three phase power is needed for a good charge.) But this is a luxury thing and not practical for most Thai families."

Whilst looking at what\u2019s available it seems there is a limit on the top speed, below that which most would want. I know people like to rent motorbikes and go on trips to Krabi etc. The limited range of an electric motorbike makes that impractical for any distance. Electric motorbikes have a range of 50-120km between charges and then a 3 or 4 hour charging time. That\u2019s not appealing to someone who wants to go any distance to have to stop every hour or 2 to charge the battery for 3 hours or more. Finally, many people I\u2019ve mentioned electric motorbikes to have the perception that they\u2019re less reliable than their gasoline equivalents. When you actually look into it, the reverse it true, electric being more reliable due to less moving parts and less heat.  Having said all that, a top speed limited to 80km/h and a range of 120km is perfect for my needs pottering around the island doing 10 to 20k per day. Hence why I\u2019ll be going for it very soon. Hope this helps. Good luck again.",

UNTIL, I did two things: reviewed advice I was given by a chiro to do twisting exercises (easy, videos on YT) AND started taking 400mg turmeric capsules in the morning x2. Now after only a few months I have absolutely no creaks in the morning getting out of bed (mattress on the floor). Tend to Slouch in office chairs all day, (and night at home) but have absolutely no pain or discomfort. Truly amazing change. I do sit ups on a bench but do deep twists as well. Over a really short amount of time, and with 800mg curcumin, I've seen big improvements including improvements with just the curcumin initially. Hope this helps.",
